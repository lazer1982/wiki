After a long time of playing together, using the same TS server and website we decided to abandon our old outfits and play under our unified moniker. This was done to end confusion and make things easier for us to coordinate work together. We are led by Delta25, the long running OL from the Militia, and a solid core of officers. We are an all fun outfit first and foremost. We have a variety of playstyles depending on what our mood is for the day. We played important rolls in NC Markov 's victories in the first two Monolith events and look forward to helping the Empire succeed in future events. We have expanded into other games as well. You can see the [M7] tag running around in BFV and CS:S and we have a WoW guild: the Seventh Militia. We are always looking for new recruits of all playstyles, new players and veterans alike.

When Planetside went retail, 3030 moved to Johari to avoid high pings, but returned to Markov when the servers merged. 3030 is a group of real-life friends from Davis, CA. Albes, Adambomb-J, Bartleby-J, Nyholm, Natron-J, Contred, Flashpoint, xAFROxCOREx, and TaintedPaladin all hail from this hella awesome town. Unfortunately all but 2 members stopped playing once Star Wars Galaxies was released. These 2 members left 3030 and formed \"The Dummkopf and Albes Show\". Sadly the show was canned by SOE's 2 man outfit bug. Dummkopf dissapeared into the frozen Canadian tundra while Albes returned to 3030. In 2006, longtime friend/neighbor of 3030, TaintedPaladin, left his outfit and finally joined the one-man duo of Albes/Bartleby-J. 3030 has extremely strict requirements for recruitment which include residence in Davis, CA and ownership of the Core Combat expansion is prohibited. This is most likely the reason why Albes was the only member for 90% of 3030's four year existence. 3030 embraces the classical Planetside ways. We don't use BFRs, we don't move the turret on our Lightnings, and we are not confined by the lattice system.

A single-use device, the ACE can be deployed as seven different items by adjusting the firemode selection. All deployed ACE and FDU devices that you own will show as a different color in the gameworld and the Continental Map . The default color is yellow. Each device can also be deconstructed by double clicking the deployable icon on the continental map and selecting to deconstruct it. '''NOTE: The Shadow Turret , Cerberus Turret , Sensor Disruptor , and Disruptor Mine require additional certifications , and cannot be used with merely the Combat Engineering certification. The options are: Remote-Detonated Charge (Boomer) Commonly referred to as a \"Boomer\", the 1st mode available on the ACE allows for the construction of this deadly remote detonated charge. Originally intended to be used as a perimeter control device, Cloakers and other enterprising induviduals have adapted them to be used as offensive weapons, particularly useful for destroying generators and Respawn tubes . Boomers can be attached to almost any static surface, indoors or out, and as long as the trigger remains intact, will remain in position, ready to be detonated. Boomers can be detonated by Jammer grenades and EMPs . Friendly Boomers are indicated by a green ring surrounding the deployed Boomer, and will not detonate to friendly jammers/EMPs. Up to 20 Boomers may be deployed by a single Combat Engineer at any one time. High Explosive Mine The enemy of many a soldier, this proximity mine fortunately can tell friend from foe, but that's about it. Lay and pray is the motto to follow after deploying this devestating weapon. Harmful to both infantry and vehicle alike, the weapons litter the battlefields. While not as versatile as Boomers (they cannot be deployed indoors and cannot be remotely detonated), they make up for it in sheer force. Susceptible to standard fire, Jammers and EMP blasts, the weapons are easily enough destroyed. Like Boomers , friendly Mines will display a green ring surrounding them and cannot be detonated by other friendly Jammers/ EMPs . Up to 20 Mines may be deployed by a single Combat Engineer at any one time. Spitfire Turret ]] The bane of many a soldier, this deployable turret is a common sight on the battlefield. Set to automatically fire at any adversary (soldier or vehicle ), the \"Spit\" is a dangerous battlefield obstacle. EMPs and Jammer grenades will disable them for a short period of time. Other methods of bypassing them include walking (default by holding left shift) and crouch walking (This DOES NOT work when the Spitfire Turret is inside a Facility SOI that has the Interlink Benefit), or using Sensor Shield . Be aware however, using a weapon or taking damage (ie from falling) will reveal your presence to the spitfire regardless of sensor shield or crouch walking, and it will fire upon you anyway. The detection and firing range of the Spitfire Turret is 50 m. Up to 10 Spitfire Turrets can be deployed by a single Combat Engineer at any one time. Be Forewarned, standing near a friendly Spitfire can cause your death as this remote weapons platform will not only shoot straight at friendly soldiers standing between them and any enemies it can see, but can also be destroyed by snipers with only two shots. When destroyed the Spitfire creates a large explosion capable of killing all infantry in close vicinity as well as damaging Vehicles . Players trained in the art Data Corruption can corrupt the programming of enemy Spitfire Turrets with their T-REK , causing them to shoot at friendlies, rather than enemies. The only way to find out if a Spitfire has been infected, is to walk into its line of fire, and see if it shoots you. This, however, is not recommended. Motion Sensor Alarm The sensor net integrated into the facilities is quite advanced, however, the range is limited. By utilizing deployable motion sensors, the sensor net can be extended. In addition, motion sensors can detect cloaked and radar-supressive units. This can be counteracted by the Sensor Shield Implant . Motion sensors can be disrupted using Jammer grenades and Command EMPs , however these will not destroy them. Up to 20 Motion Sensors can be deployed by a single Combat Engineer at any one time. If certed in Expert Hacking , a player can use their T-REK to alter the programming of an enemy Motion Sensor, causing it to display all friendlies as enemies on radar. The next time you want to boomer that red dot coming around the corner, you better make sure it's really an enemy!

Characterized by a large frozen lake and a large island in the middle, Adlivun is a surprisingly difficult place for troops to navigate. With long sight lines and little (or no) cover, the lake is a bad place for troopers. Zip lines can be hard to navigate too, as they tend to head in less than straight lines around the perimeter plateau. Even experienced cave navigators have trouble getting around Adlivun. Vehicle access is also difficult getting on and off the perimeter plateau, as ramps are infrequent and are easily accessed by nearby bases.

When deployed, it is surrounded by a cloaking \"bubble\" making it impossible to see except when very close to it.

Fortification Engineers can upgrade the Aegis to have a shield by repairing it with a Nano Dispenser (normal ammunition). A fully upgraded shield provides roughly the equivalent of a Phalanx Wall Turret worth of armor protection. Aegis Shield work rather similar to the one gained by a Shield Module . They block all fire, both enemy and friendly, as well as enemy vehicles . Note that friendly fire at the shield will reduce the Shield's power. The Aegis Shield Generator can also be upgraded by Assault Engineers with ammunition benefits. This benefit eventually wears off and will need to be re-upgraded periodically. The status of the Aegis can be seen by double clicking on the Aegis deployable icon on the Continental Map . Note that if a character has both Fortification and Assault Engineering (or Advanced Engineering ), upgrading the shields takes priority, and thus to upgrade to ammunition benefits, the shield must first be at full strength. Assault Engineers can only place 1 Aegis Shield Generator at any given time. As with all the other Deployables, if the Engineer tries to deploy a second one, the first one will deconstruct. Note however, that friendlies might be using your Shield Generator as cover, and will be exposed to enemy fire if you deconstruct it! The interference range of the Aegis is the same as that of an AMS . The Aegis shares the same interference ranges as the Tactical Resonance Area Protection (TRAP) and the One-Manned Field Turrets . Soldiers certified in Data Corruption or Electronics Expert can use their T-REK to infect enemy Aegis shields with a Virus . This virus causes the Aegis to emit a Pain Field , harming any friendly unit inside its bubble. Expert Hackers or Electronics Experts can remove an enemy virus from the Aegis and also use their REK to hack a friendly Aegis to provide a short-ranged Interlink benefit around it for friendly units. However, the radar is only active for friendly units that are inside the cloaking sphere of the Aegis. Like the ammunition upgrade, the radar eventually wears off over time and will need to be re-upgraded for continual use.

Like the NTU Siphon , each empire has their own unique model of the Armor Siphon, but they all function identically. The Armor Siphon is a close range weapon effective only against vehicles (not MAXs or infantry). The weapon bypasses any shields the vehicle has and damages the vehicle. If your BFR is damaged, the armor that you take off of the enemy is \"siphoned\" into your BFR and repairs you. Note that status damages, such as sensor arrays will NOT be repaired by the armor siphon. You must repair your BFR by other means to fix damaged systems. The armor siphon does not use any ammo, but rather uses a capacitor that recharges automatically when not in use. The capacitor has enough energy to kill the equivalent of an ANT in armor. More heavily armored targets will require a brief recharge. Jammer Grenades and EMP blasts will disable the armor siphon completely for a short time (unlike traditional BFR weapons that simply receive rate of fire penalties). The best (and almost the only practical) use of this weapon is in conjuction with the NTU Siphon in attacking enemy BFRs . By using the NTU Siphon to EMP the enemy, then using the Armor Siphon to bypass their shields, the enemy BFR can be destroyed fairly quickly.

To see the Idealab concept with ASSIST as an acronym, see Advanced Service and Supply Infantry Support Tool . Assists are Planetside 's method for tracking Support Experience Points and how support character gain Merits . An assist is awarded after a player that you supported scores a kill. This is denoted on the HUD on the Session Stats Bar with an \"A: \". Assists are also gained by operating a vehicle that has gunners or bombardiers that are making kills using your vehicles weaponry. Support activities include healing, repairing, hacking, and other helpful activities. An assist timer will start after the first kill the person you supported makes. Any additional kills during this time will also count as assists. This timer is a minimum of 5 minutes and a maximum of 10 minutes, depending how much you supported the player. If the player dies, the tracker stops, unless he is revived . Locker Hack and hot drop assist timers start at the time of the assist, rather than after the first kill. When a support-related assist is scored, a certain amount of the Battle Experience Points that the supported player scored for the kill is returned back to the supporter in what is called Support Experience Points . The amount of BEP returned to the supporter is dependent on how much you supported them, the more you supported them, the more SEP you receive. Note that \"kills\" on deployables and Wall Turrets will count as an assist on the HUD, but only player kills will count toward merits and give SEP.

I was a total newbie 3 weeks ago and most of the time I still suck at the game (my kill vs. death ratio is about 1 : 3, which is very very bad). Yet I am having fun, and that is what counts. This guide is supposed to provide some basic skills and tactics that hopefully makes Planetside enjoyable to you from the very first day of play. In this guide, I only suggest a few options that are open to you as a new player. In no way, this is a complete or comprehensive guide. Starting Planetside for the first time If you are completely new to Planetside, then there is a few things to note. Don't do the \"training\" option. This is severely broken because development continued on the game's features but the training option was never kept up to date. For example it will tell you to get a vehicle from the vehicle terminal, but it won't let you. This is frustrating and makes you think the game is broken, when in fact only training functionality is broken. So if you press \"Play\", you will be required to pick a game server. Pick the one with a low ping . For Europeans this will be Werner , for East Coast users this is likely Emerald and so on. Then create a character. Pick one of the three empires for your new character. You can create multiple characters if you like, but each character starts out with next to no abilities. So you might want to focus on developing a single character first. Improving yourself and your abilities in Planetside is based on battle Experience Points (BEP). BEP is awarded for kills that you or your squad members achieve. Also you get BEP for taking over an enemy base. Your Battle Rank (BR) increases the more BEP you collect. With each Battle Rank you gain one certification point to invest into your abilities like piloting certain vehicles or using particular weapons. Also with Battle Rank 6, 12 and 18 you can add Implants to yourself that also provide new abilities. The highest BR to achieve is 23, but it will take a long time to get there (I have just reached BR 12 after 3 weeks). The higher your BR, the slower you will advance to higher levels. On the flipside, this means that initially you will advance quickly. Yay! Initially you will be awarded battle experience points for every new thing you try for the first time. Be it wielding weapons, driving vehicles or visiting locations or using terminals. If you are completely new to Planetside, you will only have BR 1 and no experience and no certifications. You will find yourself starting at your Empire's Sanctuary. This is a protected zone that does not allow presence of enemy forces. In the Sanctuary you will find a building marked \"Training\". So go to the shooting range in the training facility and visit the equipment terminal. Press the \"G\" (use) key when looking at the equipment terminal. This opens your inventory as well as the equip window. In the equip window you can obtain armor, weapons and support items. Double click on a weapon and drag it into one of your holsters. You can also add any item into your backpack space, however then it is not immediately available for wielding. When you have a weapon in a holster, press the key corresponding to that holster (typically 1, 2 or 3). Now go to the virtual shooting range. It provides many targets to try your weapons on. Many weapons have multiple firing modes. Switch firing modes with the right mouse button. The active firing mode is indicated by the yellow dot next to the weapon. Some weapons can use two types of ammunition. Most rifles take standard bullets as well as armor piercing bullets (golden). Ammunition types are swapped with the \"X\" key. You will get BEP for a weapon if you have used ALL its firing modes at least once. Try ALL available weapons. Also get different types of armor. See how they provide different number of holsters and different space for equipment? The \"infiltration suit\" is a special type of armor. It can be activated with the \"B\" key and makes you nearly invisible. However you can only wield one pistol or one tool at a time. If you have tried all the weapons and armors, you should leave the virtual shooting range with the teleporter beam in the middle of the room. Then go to the vehicle range. It simulates a virtual terrain to try different vehicles on. Go to the vehicle pad and press \"G\". Pick any vehicle you like. The vehicle will materalize and you will be in the driver's seat. The vehicle will roll of the pad and then you get full control. To get out of a vehicle, press \"G\". To get into a gunner's seat, walk around the vehicle until you stand near a yellow circle on the ground indicating a gun. Press the \"G\" key again and you will enter the gunner's seat. Again, try all the gunner's seats on all the vehicles and use all the firing modes on each gun. That will give you a lot of experience points. If you are done with weapons and vehicle training you should have advanced to Battle Rank 4 at least. By visiting all worlds through the warpgates and also by using all kinds of terminals, you get some more BEP which should allow you to get to BR5 without having shot at a single enemy. Planning your career path Initially you had 4 certification points to spend on your skills (certs). With each new battle rank you gained extra 1 point. So now you should have 7 or 8 points to spend. Here is a few tips on how to spend your Certification points (CP). Prefer to drive tanks? Get Armored Assault I (2 CP) to obtain access to the Lightning tank. It is the only tank that can be operated entirely by one pilot. Gunning and driving are two difficult tasks to do at the same time. However it can be very rewarding and much fun to operate the Lightning. Based on that, Armored Assault II (1 extra CP) gives you access to heavier tanks, like for example the Prowler/Vanguard tanks (depending on empire) which requires two gunners and has much heavier armor. Want to pilot aircraft? Get Air Cavalry Scout (3 CP) if you want to become a combat pilot. You may even add an extra Air Cavalry Assault (2 more CP) to get access to the Reaver aircraft which is equipped with powerful air to ground missiles. Want to fix broken stuff? Also get Engineering (3 CP) if you want to be able to repair vehicles or aircraft on the field. This is a useful skill to have. It also enables you to repair broken terminals and turrets belonging to your empire. You must wield the Advanced Nano Dispenser (some call it \"glue gun\") to repair things and have Nanite Canisters in your inventory. Like to be a foot soldier? (Grunt) If you feel more like fighting close combat, get a good armor certificate, like the reinforced Exo-Suit (3 CP) plus some weapons certifications, like Medium%20Assault (2 CP) and possibly some extra weapons certs like Heavy or Special Assault , Sniping or Anti-Vehicular . With only Medium assault and the standard \" Agile Exo-Suit \" you are no match against other players and you will surely die EXTREMELY often which is frustrating. Like to wear a cyborg suit? If you want to become some sort of Cyborg, try the Mechanized Armored Exo-Suit certs (MAX). The AA MAX is the least expensive MAX cert, however it only works well against aircraft targets. When anchored (with the B key), its firing rate is doubled making it a huge threats to all aircraft (the Terran Republic 's Burster MAX that is). It is guaranteed to get you some good kills however you are very vulnerable when faced with infantry and vehicles. The Anti-Vehicle MAX (AV MAX) and Anti-Infantry (AI MAX) are more expensive certs costing 3 CP. The disadvantage of the MAX suits is that the primary weapon is fixed and you cannot wield any other weapon or any other tool. So you are limited in your abilities and you have to rely on engineers for armor repairs while wearing that suit, however you possess great firepower. Like to cloak and sabotage? If you are the sneaky guy, get the Infiltration Suit certificate (2 CP). Also get the Engineering (3 CP) and Combat Engineering (2 extra CP) skill. This will allow you to sneak up to an enemy and plant mines or boomers right below their feet which will catch them by surprise most of the time. You can also lay mines, set up turrets and motion detectors to hinder the advance of enemy troops. In order to stay hidden from motion detectors and Spitfire turrets, I recommend also getting the \"Sensor Shield\" implant one your reach BR 6. It must be turned on explicitly and drains your stamina, but prevents you from being shot by an enemy turret. Recommended implants: One recommended implant to get (once you reach BR6) is the Enhanced Targeting implant. It allows you to see who is in the enemy you are targeting and what health status he or his vehicle has. This greatly helps in deciding whether it is wise to continue pursuit of an enemy or whether to abort your attack to seek cover or get repairs. In a duel situation (vehicle against vehicle) you have to rely on that information very often. So as you see, you need to specialize. You don't have enough CP at this time to become a multi-talent. If you don't like a choice you made, you can drop certificates at a rate of one per 24 hours. Dropping a base certificate will automatically drop all certs that depend on the base certificates. Ways of getting into combat In order to go to combat, you have multiple options. By using the High Altitude Rapid Transport system (HART), you can drop onto any world, preferrably one that has some fighting going on. HART shuttles leave every 5 minutes from the Shuttle building in the sanctuary. You can then pick your drop target from the map. Pick a map with those yellow flashing stars on them. These indicate hot zone where fighting occured recently. You might want to land close to a friendly base so you can stock up on vehicles, aircraft or weapons. By using the \"instant action\" option, available when you press the ESC key, you rematerialize in a friendly facility close to a random hot spot on any world. This will get you either into a friendly base that is under attack into a friendly tower that is under attack into a friendly tower that is close to a hot spot Bases can be confusing. After 3 weeks, I still havent memorized every single base layout. There are Amp Stations , Bio Labs , Tech Plants , Dropship Centers , and Interlink Facilities , each having a different layouts and multiple stories. So I often finding myself wandering through the corridors, not ending up where I want to. The map only offers limited orientation because it only shows the level you are currently on. Typically you will spawn in \"spawn tubes.\" If you don't like the location you spawned at, you can walk right back into the spawn tube and press \"G\" to rematerialize at a location you choose. You can either pick your empire's sactuary, or one of two or three locations indicated on the map in flashing circles - the nearest facility, the nearest tower, and the nearest AMS. One special place for materializing are so called Advanced Mobile Stations (AMS). These are vehicles that typically get driven close to an enemy base or tower and deployed. Friendly soldiers can spawn at that location and equip with basic armor and weaponry (no MAX armor though and no vehicles or aircraft!). And the best thing is: The AMSes have a shield around them that make them invisible to the enemy's eyes and radar. So an AMS acts as a trojan horse that can be driven close to the enemy's location and hopefully offers a staging ground for a successful invasion by foot. Tip: If you want to select a particular base or AMS for respawning, use a Matrixing panel to permanently add this base to the selection available on your map for respawning. Matrixing panels are small rectangular panels in the wall inside a base or at an AMS. As a final option, you can take the warpgates from the Sactuary to other worlds. The broadcast warpgate will offer the largest number of choices to go to. In contrast to \"Instant action\" or HART, you can use warpgates in your vehicles. This is probably best if you plan to attack in large numbers with heavy machinery. Basic Game Objectives Do not shoot friendly troops. Doing so incurs Grief points . Above 1000 grief points, your weapons will be DISABLED and your operating of vehicles will be limited to walking speed. Grief points are reduced slowly at a constant rate. Drive the enemy out of your own facilities and bases Make sure the enemy cannot hack your base's control console . Defend your base's generator . Without it, no terminal or turret will work. Keep your base turrets operative (repair them) Keep your bases Nanite silos filled (the percentage is indicated on the map below each base name). When the silo runs dry, the base turns neutral which is a bad thing if it was your own base, but a good thing if it is an enemy base. Broken turrets and terminals drain energy from the silo! Advanced Nanite Transport vehicles (ANTs) must be used to collect Nanites from warpgates and transport them to the silos. Hack enemy Facilities . There are two types of facilities. Some must be hacked and held for 15 minutes to conquer, others must be hacked and a LLU must be taken to your own base (similar to a \"capture the flag\" game). Hacking is done with the Remote Electronics Kit (REK). It disables door locks on enemy facilities and allows hacking the control console. Hacking takes time. General Tactics and Tips Try team play. This is actually required to operate many vehicles effectively. Try to join a squad, because you also rack up experience points from kills that squad members perform. Typing LFS (looking for squad) into the chat will inform other players (e.g. typing /local LFS in the chat) that you want to join a squad. A tool called TeamSpeak is available free of charge on the Internet and can be used to provide voice communications for squads and outfits. Monitor the global chat. High ranking players like to give orders what bases should be defended or attacked. Only experienced players with command rank can give global or continent orders Make use of provided transport. Galaxy planes can transport one light vehicle and several passengers plus three gunners. Use alt-g to drop out of the plane over the target. Lodestar transports can transport heavy vehicles and provide a base for repairing/re-equipping vehicles. And there is multiple armored infantry transports like Deliverer, Sunderer. After respawning, get out of your pyjamas immediately! (Pyjamas: the Standard Armor). At least wear the Agile Exosuit which offers double the protection of the Standard armor. If you have the Reinforced Exosuit (Rexo) certificate, wear that one unless you intend to pilot certain vehicles that cannot be piloted with Rexo. For faster equipping after respawning, make use of the favorites system at the equipment terminals. This also works for vehicle trunk space at a Repair/rearm.md terminal. Lay mines, set up turrets and motion detectors inside and around your bases and towers and at strategic points like bridges and roads (requires combat engineering cert) Destroy enemy AMS stations close to your own facilities. Finding them can be difficult. They show up on radar only when not deployed. Many enemy soldiers appearing out of thin air in your back yard are an indicator that an AMS may be present. When your base has been hacked, terminals will no longer function. Use the lockers in various parts of the base and take out weapons and ammunitions that you have placed there before. Even though there are multiple lockers in multiple bases, they all act as if there was only one locker. Lightning Tactics Remember that the Lightning is a LIGHT tank, that means its armor is relatively weak. However it is very agile and can be operated by a single person. While driving you usually need to look forward, otherwise you might run into obstacles. This is a bad thing if you need to flee from a pursuing vehicle because it will be difficult to gun backwards while driving forward! So there is a few guidelines for operating a Lightning successfully: Learn to operate the gun effectively against moving targets. You need to lead and you also need to account for the arcing projectile. This can be difficult. Use the chain gun against infantry targets and aircraft (switch firing modes) Don't ever drive into large groups of enemy forces. If they all target you, you stand have ZERO chance. If you don't die instantly, you will usually die running away because gunning while fleeing is difficult (see above) Don't take on fights with Battleframes (BFRs). They are more powerful and will typically destroy you. Avoid charging heavy tanks like Prowlers or Vanguards, unless they are already damaged or you are engaging the enemy in a group. Try operating the Lightning in packs for increased efficiency. You stand a larger chance if your shields are fully charged. To charge shields, stay inside a friendly base's sphere of influence for a while (your empire needs to possess a linked Amp station on the continent in order to charge vehicle shields). When damaged, seek cover in a safe distance from the fighting hotspot, leave the vehicle and use your Advanced Nano Dispenser (glue gun) to fix it. Watch out for enemy cloakers or aircraft while fixing your vehicle. If anything shoots at you, get back into the vehicle immediately. Your vehicle can also be repaired at a friendly base at a rearm/repair terminal. The lightning can also work as mobile artillery because of its arcing projectiles. You can shell the courtyard of an enemy facility easily if you place the tank on a good location outside (e.g. a hill). Just watch for enemy aircraft! Infantry are usually easy targets, unless you hit a group that is equipped with anti-vehicular weapons. You can also run over infantry targets to injure or kill them. When you get hit, try to figure out what hits you and from where. Decide what is the largest threat to you and whether it is better to attack or reatreat. Spitfire turrets can be a great danger, especially if there is more than one firing at you. Sometimes running them over works best. Wall turrets at bases are extremely powerful. Attack these from behind cover. It requires about 10 shells to take one out or more than 300 chaingun rounds! MINES! Watch out for mines on roads, bridges and near enemy installations. Two mines can bring a lightning from perfect state to nearly destroyed (\"lost control of the vehicle\"). Three mines will destroy it on the spot. After hit by mines, stop, go reverse the same way you came and fix your vehicle. Fire on mines using 3-4 shells or dozens of chaingun rounds on the exact location of an enemy mine will destroy them. However due to limited close-attack range it is difficult to target mines from a Lightning. You can make use of the trunk space of your Lightning for storing useful gear (not just tank shells and chaingun rounds). You can store your Advanced Nano Dispenser in it if you dont want to carry it in your backpacks. Infiltration Tactics So you have become cloaker and want to be effective in what you are doing? Basics Never ever forget to enable your cloak (B key) when you suspect enemies nearby. To check this, you can wield a weapon, which should then appear transparent. The little armor icon on the HUD will also appear differently when cloaked. Last but not least you can use the third person view (T key) to verify your cloak is active. Cloakers should enable the Sensor Shield implant when moving near turrets and motion sensors. The implant takes a while to initialize after respawning. Be patient. If your stamina runs low and you need Sensor Shield, rest for a while to regain stamina. Cloakers have limited space in their backpack and only one pistol holster. So they can only wield a pistol, a grenade or a remote electronics kit at a time. Carefully plan what you are taking with you. Don't forget the REK if you want to hack a base or tower. Cloakers can use a melee attack against infantry (key: 5, wields a knife). Using the \"melee booster\" implant the knife can be lethal on the first strike at the expense of some of your stamina points. Be aware that the enemy can use the dark light implant to see you. Be aware that some enemies can have graphics details settings or graphics drivers tweaked so they can more easily spot you. It is safer to approach an enemy from behind. Laying mines or setting up turrets requires the combat engineering certificate on top of the engineering certificate (5 CP total). This ability can also be used as a non-cloaker, but it is not recommended when operating in the midst of an enemy presence. Be aware that your location is given away if you operate weapons or tools, plant mines/boomers or other deployables. Certain actions, like firing a weapon or using the REK temporarily negate sensor shield and makes enemy turrets fire at you. Don't use the REK on doors that have an enemy turret and a motion detector installed nearby. You will also be visible when hit by enemy or friendly fire. Stay out of the line of fire. Try to place boomers at spots often frequented by enemy soldiers or vehicles. Stay in visual range and operate the detonator in the moment an enemy passes over your boomer. You can stack multiple boomers to achieve a more powerful explosion! Boomers can also be placed on walls or overhead in doorframes. You can use an unarmed ATV vehicle while cloaked. That is the \"Wraith\". Requires the cheap (1 CP) ATV cert. You can easily infiltrate and hack a base when cloaked. You can also attack an enemy facility's generator. However plan for a counterattack after the enemy notices your presence. Coordinate with friendly troops to make sure the hacked command center gets defended. You can also throw grenades (frag, plasma or jammers) at the enemy when cloaked. This briefly affects your invisibility, so its best to attack the enemy from behind. Cloakers can eject out of an aircraft (e.g. a Mosquito which is hard to spot on radar for the enemy) and drop right on their intended target. Advanced Knowledge If your enemy has the Audio Amplifier Implant enabled, you need to use sensor shield AND crouch walk (C key) to remain invisible from his radar. Unfortunately there is no way to tell who has this implant and who has not. You can hack enemy vehicles and take ownership. This requires the Advanced Hacking certificate (5 CP in total). Nothing is more annoying to the enemy than taking enemy heavy armor and using their own heavy weapons against them. Be aware that in some vehicles you can only be pilot or gunner but never both at the same time and you require the corresponding cert do pilot it. Mines can be used to trigger boomers if you are not around. Mines can only be laid outdoors. Stack a mine close to a boomer and it will set of the boomer as well. This has a devastating effect! If the detonator of a boomer dematerializes, the boomer also dematerializes and vice versa. That means if you get killed while there were detonators in your inventory, the boomers also go away! To avoid this problem, put the detonators into your locker or a vehicle trunk (but make sure the vehicle stays around long enough). You can also drop the detonators, at the risk of someone else (enemies) picking them up. Burster MAX Tactics NOTE: This is a guide for using The TR Burster MAX, NOT the VS Starfire or NC Sparrow MAX I did this tonight with great success. Within a few hours I racked up 32000 experience points and 29 kills. The tactics described here may not be honorable, but it surely results in lots of kills. Camp an enemy air tower or base that is likely used as a repair base for Mosquitos and Reavers or as staging area for aerial assaults (e.g. drops from a Galaxy transport). Climb a hill nearby, try to stay exposed as little as possible and wait for targets. Anchor your AA MAX before shooting (B key). When anchored you have a limited turning radius. Make sure the anchor radius you selected suits your needs. Mossies or Reavers hovering over an air tower's rearm pad are easy targets. Just pump a round of 20-25 projectiles towards the pad. Most of the time the target will be destroyed before the pilot knows what hit him. Reload after shooting a magazine only partially (R key). It is frustrating if a target manages to escape because the auto-reload kicked in after a few fired rounds. For moving targets, lead ahead. The further away the target and the faster it is moving, the greater the lead has to be. Watch for revenge missions. Sometimes a downed pilot will return in a Mossie, eject right next to you and try to finish you off with his assault weapons. You have little chance in that case. You can either run and hide or try to duel it out. AA shells do not cause great damage to infantry, beware. In other cases, the downed pilots will alert teammates in heavy armor to hunt you down. Try to disappear behind the mountain and pop up someplace else before they find you. Hitting heavy targets like a Galaxy results in lots of BEP, especially if the Galaxy was loaded with passengers. If you happen to camp a staging point for a Galaxy drop, you can totally screw their intended mission and rack up lots of BEP. Your BEP rewards can be increased by as much as 50% if you play on a continent where two other factions duel it out and your population is much smaller than the other factions. I got a funny chat message once, saying \"lol. you have no business on this continent, TR!\" after I downed an enemy pilot on such a continent. You can move much faster by engaging the run mode (Q key), however your weapons are down while you run. BEWARE: You cannot come to a sudden stop, it will take a few seconds to slow down. (S key). So if you run towards a ledge, make sure you stop well ahead or you will overshoot the ledge and fall down. SECRET TRICK: hold the S key while at the same time hitting the strafe keys (A or D) and you will immediately stop moving forward (you will move sidewards though). You can use this to dodge bullets or rockets that have been fired at you with a lead. You can also use this to avoid overshooting the position you are running to.

In this guide, I only suggest a few options that are open to you as a new player. In no way, this is a complete or comprehensive guide.","title":"Astrala's Guide to Planetside"},{"location":"Astrala%27s_Guide_to_Planetside/#starting-planetside-for-the-first-time","text":"If you are completely new to Planetside, then there is a few things to note. Don't do the \"training\" option. This is severely broken because development continued on the game's features but the training option was never kept up to date. For example it will tell you to get a vehicle from the vehicle terminal, but it won't let you. This is frustrating and makes you think the game is broken, when in fact only training functionality is broken. So if you press \"Play\", you will be required to pick a game server. Pick the one with a low ping . For Europeans this will be Werner , for East Coast users this is likely Emerald and so on. Then create a character. Pick one of the three empires for your new character. You can create multiple characters if you like, but each character starts out with next to no abilities. So you might want to focus on developing a single character first. Improving yourself and your abilities in Planetside is based on battle Experience Points (BEP). BEP is awarded for kills that you or your squad members achieve. Also you get BEP for taking over an enemy base. Your Battle Rank (BR) increases the more BEP you collect. With each Battle Rank you gain one certification point to invest into your abilities like piloting certain vehicles or using particular weapons. Also with Battle Rank 6, 12 and 18 you can add Implants to yourself that also provide new abilities. The highest BR to achieve is 23, but it will take a long time to get there (I have just reached BR 12 after 3 weeks). The higher your BR, the slower you will advance to higher levels. On the flipside, this means that initially you will advance quickly. Yay! Initially you will be awarded battle experience points for every new thing you try for the first time. Be it wielding weapons, driving vehicles or visiting locations or using terminals. If you are completely new to Planetside, you will only have BR 1 and no experience and no certifications. You will find yourself starting at your Empire's Sanctuary. This is a protected zone that does not allow presence of enemy forces. In the Sanctuary you will find a building marked \"Training\". So go to the shooting range in the training facility and visit the equipment terminal. Press the \"G\" (use) key when looking at the equipment terminal. This opens your inventory as well as the equip window. In the equip window you can obtain armor, weapons and support items. Double click on a weapon and drag it into one of your holsters. You can also add any item into your backpack space, however then it is not immediately available for wielding. When you have a weapon in a holster, press the key corresponding to that holster (typically 1, 2 or 3). Now go to the virtual shooting range. It provides many targets to try your weapons on. Many weapons have multiple firing modes. Switch firing modes with the right mouse button. The active firing mode is indicated by the yellow dot next to the weapon. Some weapons can use two types of ammunition. Most rifles take standard bullets as well as armor piercing bullets (golden). Ammunition types are swapped with the \"X\" key. You will get BEP for a weapon if you have used ALL its firing modes at least once. Try ALL available weapons. Also get different types of armor. See how they provide different number of holsters and different space for equipment? The \"infiltration suit\" is a special type of armor. It can be activated with the \"B\" key and makes you nearly invisible. However you can only wield one pistol or one tool at a time. If you have tried all the weapons and armors, you should leave the virtual shooting range with the teleporter beam in the middle of the room. Then go to the vehicle range. It simulates a virtual terrain to try different vehicles on. Go to the vehicle pad and press \"G\". Pick any vehicle you like. The vehicle will materalize and you will be in the driver's seat. The vehicle will roll of the pad and then you get full control. To get out of a vehicle, press \"G\". To get into a gunner's seat, walk around the vehicle until you stand near a yellow circle on the ground indicating a gun. Press the \"G\" key again and you will enter the gunner's seat. Again, try all the gunner's seats on all the vehicles and use all the firing modes on each gun. That will give you a lot of experience points. If you are done with weapons and vehicle training you should have advanced to Battle Rank 4 at least. By visiting all worlds through the warpgates and also by using all kinds of terminals, you get some more BEP which should allow you to get to BR5 without having shot at a single enemy.","title":"Starting Planetside for the first time"},{"location":"Astrala%27s_Guide_to_Planetside/#planning-your-career-path","text":"Initially you had 4 certification points to spend on your skills (certs).

The AA MAX is the least expensive MAX cert, however it only works well against aircraft targets. When anchored (with the B key), its firing rate is doubled making it a huge threats to all aircraft (the Terran Republic 's Burster MAX that is). It is guaranteed to get you some good kills however you are very vulnerable when faced with infantry and vehicles. The Anti-Vehicle MAX (AV MAX) and Anti-Infantry (AI MAX) are more expensive certs costing 3 CP. The disadvantage of the MAX suits is that the primary weapon is fixed and you cannot wield any other weapon or any other tool. So you are limited in your abilities and you have to rely on engineers for armor repairs while wearing that suit, however you possess great firepower.","title":"Like to wear a cyborg suit?"},{"location":"Astrala%27s_Guide_to_Planetside/#like-to-cloak-and-sabotage","text":"If you are the sneaky guy, get the Infiltration Suit certificate (2 CP). Also get the Engineering (3 CP) and Combat Engineering (2 extra CP) skill. This will allow you to sneak up to an enemy and plant mines or boomers right below their feet which will catch them by surprise most of the time. You can also lay mines, set up turrets and motion detectors to hinder the advance of enemy troops. In order to stay hidden from motion detectors and Spitfire turrets, I recommend also getting the \"Sensor Shield\" implant one your reach BR 6. It must be turned on explicitly and drains your stamina, but prevents you from being shot by an enemy turret.","title":"Like to cloak and sabotage?"},{"location":"Astrala%27s_Guide_to_Planetside/#recommended-implants","text":"One recommended implant to get (once you reach BR6) is the Enhanced Targeting implant. It allows you to see who is in the enemy you are targeting and what health status he or his vehicle has. This greatly helps in deciding whether it is wise to continue pursuit of an enemy or whether to abort your attack to seek cover or get repairs. In a duel situation (vehicle against vehicle) you have to rely on that information very often. So as you see, you need to specialize. You don't have enough CP at this time to become a multi-talent. If you don't like a choice you made, you can drop certificates at a rate of one per 24 hours. Dropping a base certificate will automatically drop all certs that depend on the base certificates.","title":"Recommended implants:"},{"location":"Astrala%27s_Guide_to_Planetside/#ways-of-getting-into-combat","text":"In order to go to combat, you have multiple options. By using the High Altitude Rapid Transport system (HART), you can drop onto any world, preferrably one that has some fighting going on. HART shuttles leave every 5 minutes from the Shuttle building in the sanctuary. You can then pick your drop target from the map. Pick a map with those yellow flashing stars on them. These indicate hot zone where fighting occured recently. You might want to land close to a friendly base so you can stock up on vehicles, aircraft or weapons. By using the \"instant action\" option, available when you press the ESC key, you rematerialize in a friendly facility close to a random hot spot on any world. This will get you either into a friendly base that is under attack into a friendly tower that is under attack into a friendly tower that is close to a hot spot Bases can be confusing. After 3 weeks, I still havent memorized every single base layout. There are Amp Stations , Bio Labs , Tech Plants , Dropship Centers , and Interlink Facilities , each having a different layouts and multiple stories. So I often finding myself wandering through the corridors, not ending up where I want to. The map only offers limited orientation because it only shows the level you are currently on. Typically you will spawn in \"spawn tubes.\" If you don't like the location you spawned at, you can walk right back into the spawn tube and press \"G\" to rematerialize at a location you choose. You can either pick your empire's sactuary, or one of two or three locations indicated on the map in flashing circles - the nearest facility, the nearest tower, and the nearest AMS. One special place for materializing are so called Advanced Mobile Stations (AMS). These are vehicles that typically get driven close to an enemy base or tower and deployed. Friendly soldiers can spawn at that location and equip with basic armor and weaponry (no MAX armor though and no vehicles or aircraft!). And the best thing is: The AMSes have a shield around them that make them invisible to the enemy's eyes and radar. So an AMS acts as a trojan horse that can be driven close to the enemy's location and hopefully offers a staging ground for a successful invasion by foot. Tip: If you want to select a particular base or AMS for respawning, use a Matrixing panel to permanently add this base to the selection available on your map for respawning. Matrixing panels are small rectangular panels in the wall inside a base or at an AMS. As a final option, you can take the warpgates from the Sactuary to other worlds. The broadcast warpgate will offer the largest number of choices to go to. In contrast to \"Instant action\" or HART, you can use warpgates in your vehicles. This is probably best if you plan to attack in large numbers with heavy machinery.","title":"Ways of getting into combat"},{"location":"Astrala%27s_Guide_to_Planetside/#basic-game-objectives","text":"Do not shoot friendly troops. Doing so incurs Grief points . Above 1000 grief points, your weapons will be DISABLED and your operating of vehicles will be limited to walking speed. Grief points are reduced slowly at a constant rate. Drive the enemy out of your own facilities and bases Make sure the enemy cannot hack your base's control console . Defend your base's generator . Without it, no terminal or turret will work. Keep your base turrets operative (repair them) Keep your bases Nanite silos filled (the percentage is indicated on the map below each base name). When the silo runs dry, the base turns neutral which is a bad thing if it was your own base, but a good thing if it is an enemy base. Broken turrets and terminals drain energy from the silo! Advanced Nanite Transport vehicles (ANTs) must be used to collect Nanites from warpgates and transport them to the silos. Hack enemy Facilities . There are two types of facilities. Some must be hacked and held for 15 minutes to conquer, others must be hacked and a LLU must be taken to your own base (similar to a \"capture the flag\" game). Hacking is done with the Remote Electronics Kit (REK). It disables door locks on enemy facilities and allows hacking the control console. Hacking takes time.","title":"Basic Game Objectives"},{"location":"Astrala%27s_Guide_to_Planetside/#general-tactics-and-tips","text":"Try team play. This is actually required to operate many vehicles effectively. Try to join a squad, because you also rack up experience points from kills that squad members perform. Typing LFS (looking for squad) into the chat will inform other players (e.g. typing /local LFS in the chat) that you want to join a squad. A tool called TeamSpeak is available free of charge on the Internet and can be used to provide voice communications for squads and outfits. Monitor the global chat. High ranking players like to give orders what bases should be defended or attacked. Only experienced players with command rank can give global or continent orders Make use of provided transport. Galaxy planes can transport one light vehicle and several passengers plus three gunners. Use alt-g to drop out of the plane over the target. Lodestar transports can transport heavy vehicles and provide a base for repairing/re-equipping vehicles. And there is multiple armored infantry transports like Deliverer, Sunderer. After respawning, get out of your pyjamas immediately! (Pyjamas: the Standard Armor). At least wear the Agile Exosuit which offers double the protection of the Standard armor. If you have the Reinforced Exosuit (Rexo) certificate, wear that one unless you intend to pilot certain vehicles that cannot be piloted with Rexo. For faster equipping after respawning, make use of the favorites system at the equipment terminals. This also works for vehicle trunk space at a Repair/rearm.md terminal. Lay mines, set up turrets and motion detectors inside and around your bases and towers and at strategic points like bridges and roads (requires combat engineering cert) Destroy enemy AMS stations close to your own facilities. Finding them can be difficult. They show up on radar only when not deployed. Many enemy soldiers appearing out of thin air in your back yard are an indicator that an AMS may be present. When your base has been hacked, terminals will no longer function. Use the lockers in various parts of the base and take out weapons and ammunitions that you have placed there before. Even though there are multiple lockers in multiple bases, they all act as if there was only one locker.","title":"General Tactics and Tips"},{"location":"Astrala%27s_Guide_to_Planetside/#lightning-tactics","text":"Remember that the Lightning is a LIGHT tank, that means its armor is relatively weak. However it is very agile and can be operated by a single person. While driving you usually need to look forward, otherwise you might run into obstacles. This is a bad thing if you need to flee from a pursuing vehicle because it will be difficult to gun backwards while driving forward! So there is a few guidelines for operating a Lightning successfully: Learn to operate the gun effectively against moving targets. You need to lead and you also need to account for the arcing projectile. This can be difficult. Use the chain gun against infantry targets and aircraft (switch firing modes) Don't ever drive into large groups of enemy forces. If they all target you, you stand have ZERO chance. If you don't die instantly, you will usually die running away because gunning while fleeing is difficult (see above) Don't take on fights with Battleframes (BFRs). They are more powerful and will typically destroy you. Avoid charging heavy tanks like Prowlers or Vanguards, unless they are already damaged or you are engaging the enemy in a group. Try operating the Lightning in packs for increased efficiency. You stand a larger chance if your shields are fully charged. To charge shields, stay inside a friendly base's sphere of influence for a while (your empire needs to possess a linked Amp station on the continent in order to charge vehicle shields). When damaged, seek cover in a safe distance from the fighting hotspot, leave the vehicle and use your Advanced Nano Dispenser (glue gun) to fix it. Watch out for enemy cloakers or aircraft while fixing your vehicle. If anything shoots at you, get back into the vehicle immediately. Your vehicle can also be repaired at a friendly base at a rearm/repair terminal. The lightning can also work as mobile artillery because of its arcing projectiles. You can shell the courtyard of an enemy facility easily if you place the tank on a good location outside (e.g. a hill). Just watch for enemy aircraft! Infantry are usually easy targets, unless you hit a group that is equipped with anti-vehicular weapons. You can also run over infantry targets to injure or kill them. When you get hit, try to figure out what hits you and from where. Decide what is the largest threat to you and whether it is better to attack or reatreat. Spitfire turrets can be a great danger, especially if there is more than one firing at you. Sometimes running them over works best. Wall turrets at bases are extremely powerful. Attack these from behind cover. It requires about 10 shells to take one out or more than 300 chaingun rounds! MINES! Watch out for mines on roads, bridges and near enemy installations. Two mines can bring a lightning from perfect state to nearly destroyed (\"lost control of the vehicle\"). Three mines will destroy it on the spot. After hit by mines, stop, go reverse the same way you came and fix your vehicle. Fire on mines using 3-4 shells or dozens of chaingun rounds on the exact location of an enemy mine will destroy them. However due to limited close-attack range it is difficult to target mines from a Lightning. You can make use of the trunk space of your Lightning for storing useful gear (not just tank shells and chaingun rounds). You can store your Advanced Nano Dispenser in it if you dont want to carry it in your backpacks.","title":"Lightning Tactics"},{"location":"Astrala%27s_Guide_to_Planetside/#infiltration-tactics","text":"So you have become cloaker and want to be effective in what you are doing? Basics Never ever forget to enable your cloak (B key) when you suspect enemies nearby. To check this, you can wield a weapon, which should then appear transparent. The little armor icon on the HUD will also appear differently when cloaked. Last but not least you can use the third person view (T key) to verify your cloak is active. Cloakers should enable the Sensor Shield implant when moving near turrets and motion sensors. The implant takes a while to initialize after respawning. Be patient. If your stamina runs low and you need Sensor Shield, rest for a while to regain stamina. Cloakers have limited space in their backpack and only one pistol holster. So they can only wield a pistol, a grenade or a remote electronics kit at a time. Carefully plan what you are taking with you. Don't forget the REK if you want to hack a base or tower. Cloakers can use a melee attack against infantry (key: 5, wields a knife). Using the \"melee booster\" implant the knife can be lethal on the first strike at the expense of some of your stamina points. Be aware that the enemy can use the dark light implant to see you. Be aware that some enemies can have graphics details settings or graphics drivers tweaked so they can more easily spot you. It is safer to approach an enemy from behind. Laying mines or setting up turrets requires the combat engineering certificate on top of the engineering certificate (5 CP total). This ability can also be used as a non-cloaker, but it is not recommended when operating in the midst of an enemy presence. Be aware that your location is given away if you operate weapons or tools, plant mines/boomers or other deployables. Certain actions, like firing a weapon or using the REK temporarily negate sensor shield and makes enemy turrets fire at you. Don't use the REK on doors that have an enemy turret and a motion detector installed nearby. You will also be visible when hit by enemy or friendly fire. Stay out of the line of fire. Try to place boomers at spots often frequented by enemy soldiers or vehicles. Stay in visual range and operate the detonator in the moment an enemy passes over your boomer. You can stack multiple boomers to achieve a more powerful explosion! Boomers can also be placed on walls or overhead in doorframes. You can use an unarmed ATV vehicle while cloaked. That is the \"Wraith\". Requires the cheap (1 CP) ATV cert. You can easily infiltrate and hack a base when cloaked. You can also attack an enemy facility's generator. However plan for a counterattack after the enemy notices your presence. Coordinate with friendly troops to make sure the hacked command center gets defended. You can also throw grenades (frag, plasma or jammers) at the enemy when cloaked. This briefly affects your invisibility, so its best to attack the enemy from behind. Cloakers can eject out of an aircraft (e.g. a Mosquito which is hard to spot on radar for the enemy) and drop right on their intended target. Advanced Knowledge If your enemy has the Audio Amplifier Implant enabled, you need to use sensor shield AND crouch walk (C key) to remain invisible from his radar. Unfortunately there is no way to tell who has this implant and who has not. You can hack enemy vehicles and take ownership. This requires the Advanced Hacking certificate (5 CP in total). Nothing is more annoying to the enemy than taking enemy heavy armor and using their own heavy weapons against them. Be aware that in some vehicles you can only be pilot or gunner but never both at the same time and you require the corresponding cert do pilot it. Mines can be used to trigger boomers if you are not around. Mines can only be laid outdoors. Stack a mine close to a boomer and it will set of the boomer as well. This has a devastating effect! If the detonator of a boomer dematerializes, the boomer also dematerializes and vice versa. That means if you get killed while there were detonators in your inventory, the boomers also go away! To avoid this problem, put the detonators into your locker or a vehicle trunk (but make sure the vehicle stays around long enough). You can also drop the detonators, at the risk of someone else (enemies) picking them up.","title":"Infiltration Tactics"},{"location":"Astrala%27s_Guide_to_Planetside/#burster-max-tactics","text":"NOTE: This is a guide for using The TR Burster MAX, NOT the VS Starfire or NC Sparrow MAX I did this tonight with great success. Within a few hours I racked up 32000 experience points and 29 kills. The tactics described here may not be honorable, but it surely results in lots of kills. Camp an enemy air tower or base that is likely used as a repair base for Mosquitos and Reavers or as staging area for aerial assaults (e.g. drops from a Galaxy transport). Climb a hill nearby, try to stay exposed as little as possible and wait for targets. Anchor your AA MAX before shooting (B key). When anchored you have a limited turning radius. Make sure the anchor radius you selected suits your needs. Mossies or Reavers hovering over an air tower's rearm pad are easy targets. Just pump a round of 20-25 projectiles towards the pad. Most of the time the target will be destroyed before the pilot knows what hit him. Reload after shooting a magazine only partially (R key). It is frustrating if a target manages to escape because the auto-reload kicked in after a few fired rounds. For moving targets, lead ahead. The further away the target and the faster it is moving, the greater the lead has to be. Watch for revenge missions. Sometimes a downed pilot will return in a Mossie, eject right next to you and try to finish you off with his assault weapons. You have little chance in that case. You can either run and hide or try to duel it out. AA shells do not cause great damage to infantry, beware. In other cases, the downed pilots will alert teammates in heavy armor to hunt you down. Try to disappear behind the mountain and pop up someplace else before they find you. Hitting heavy targets like a Galaxy results in lots of BEP, especially if the Galaxy was loaded with passengers. If you happen to camp a staging point for a Galaxy drop, you can totally screw their intended mission and rack up lots of BEP. Your BEP rewards can be increased by as much as 50% if you play on a continent where two other factions duel it out and your population is much smaller than the other factions. I got a funny chat message once, saying \"lol. you have no business on this continent, TR!\" after I downed an enemy pilot on such a continent. You can move much faster by engaging the run mode (Q key), however your weapons are down while you run. BEWARE: You cannot come to a sudden stop, it will take a few seconds to slow down. (S key). So if you run towards a ledge, make sure you stop well ahead or you will overshoot the ledge and fall down. SECRET TRICK: hold the S key while at the same time hitting the strafe keys (A or D) and you will immediately stop moving forward (you will move sidewards though). You can use this to dodge bullets or rockets that have been fired at you with a lead. You can also use this to avoid overshooting the position you are running to.","title":"Burster MAX Tactics"},{"location":"Astrala%27s_Guide_to_Planetside/#credits","text":"Written by: (Astrala, TR on Werner.

At the end of the week, during that weekend, the second part of the event began: All over the planets of the Auraxian System , Monolith Units began spawning. Their spawning would turn every facility and tower on the planet Neutral . The goal was to move the Monolith Unit from the Monolith to the Capitol 's Main terminal . In order to succeed, each Empire had to capture facilities in order to capture the Capitol. (This requires holding two Sub-Capitols .) The result was a race to hack the facilities , find the Monolith, capture the Capitol, and move the Monolith Unit to the Capitol. Winners of the event for each Server were posted on the main forums. The prizes were as follows: 1st place: Only 5 Cavern Captures required for a soldier to get their BFR Imprint 2nd place: Only 7 Cavern captures required for a soldier to get their BFR Imprint 3rd place: The standard 10 Cavern captures were required for a soldier to get their BFR imprint. These winning conditions were in place for two weeks after the event, after which, soldiers from all 3 Empires had to get the full 10 Cavern captures for their imprint.

So equip every weapon and support item you can, fire them if you want to. Putting on Rexo armor makes this process faster. Don't forget, each MAX Armor has its own weapon systems, and they award you Experience Points also. To leave VR, hop into one of those prism-looking beams. Same goes for vehicles; you'll spawn next to the ground vehicle pad. Drive everything. If it has a gunner spot, park and hop in the gunner slot too. When you're done, visit the BFR shack (just a touch northeast of the vehicle pad) and use both battle frames. if you want to switch out weapons, walk it over to the rearm silo behind the ground vehicle pad you were just using, it's on the hill to the east of the vehicle-pad. Then head to the airpad, it's a good distance, heading west by southwest. It's up on a hill, use your map to pinpoint it. There, do the same thing. fly everything, use all the gunner seats.

However, the technology could not be perfected there. The republic of Earth then sent the schematics for BFRs through the micro-wormhole between Earth and the Auraxian System to the three warring empires of Auraxis. Each side received the schematics, and began making their own variants of the technology. The Terran Republic developed the Colossus . The Vanu Sovereignty developed the Aphelion . The New Conglomerate developed the Peregrine . However, the systems of a BFR were very complicated, proving to be too much of a burden for a single pilot. The Auraxian Core had felt the deaths of all the prototype BFR pilots, and sent the empires of Auraxis a message. This message came in the form of Monoliths that spawned Resonance Crystals that allowed a single pilot to control the complex systems of a BFR. Each empire adapted the crystals into their soldiers, and the empires of Auraxis were able to field BFRs and develop tactics for their use, as well as their defeat. What is a BFR? BFRs themselves are robotic vehicles that move via a walking mechanism, are armed with two guns on their arms, and are protected by a powerful shield. These steel titans are driven by a single pilot, and are often perceived as an unstoppable one-man death machine. BFRs are the only vehicle in PlanetSide that utilize hitbox technology, allowing a hit to a specific region of the BFR to damage a specific system (guns, sensors, transit mode, and shields are the systems that can be damaged, although a fifth hitbox allows items in the trunk such as ammunition to be destroyed). While the shields regenerate automatically over time, a BFR system that is damaged can only be restored by repairing the BFR. Possible BFR damage states Movement Servo Pivot speed reduction Reverse speed reduction Forward speed reduction Transit mode offline Trunk 1 item in trunk destroyed 2 items in trunk destroyed All items in trunk destroyed Sensor Array (minimap) Blind to aircraft Blind to ground targets Blind to projectiles Blind to all enemies Shield Generator Reduction in shield recharge rate Shields offline for a short time (about 5-7 seconds) Shield generator destroyed Weapons Cone of fire increase Reload time increase Increase in time between shots Decrease in weapon's range Weapon offline for a short time Weapon destroyed (must replace, cannot be repaired) Flight Pod (Flight Variants only) Reduction in capacitor use Reduction in forward thrust Reduction in vertical thrust Flight pod offline for a short time Flight pod destroyed (cannot be repaired, must get a new BFR to fix!) Additionally, Jammer grenades and EMP blasts can temporarily cripple a BFR, causing it to move and fire much more slowly, and in the case of the flight variants, completely disabling the flight systems until the effect wears off. The Variants There are two kinds of variants: the gunner variant (or basic BFR) and the flight variant . Gunner variants Gunner variants have, in addition to the pilot weapons, an extra gunner pod on their backs which can be manned by a second soldier. They also have more armor and a faster shield regeneration rate than their flight counterparts, which gives them greater \"staying power.\" In the gunner variant, the shields will be activated whenever a soldier enters either the pilot or gunner's seat, and will remain active as long one or both of these positions is occupied. Emptying both positions will deactivate the shields, leaving the BFR directly vulnerable to attack or jacking . There is a known issue regarding the gunner no being able to aim left and right. However, this is a fairly rare bug. Empire-specific gunner variants The Colossus ( Terran Republic ) The Peregrine ( New Conglomerate ) The Aphelion ( Vanu Sovereignty ) Flight variants Flight variants are single-pilot BFRs with a flight pack on their backs to allow the BFR to fly vertically for a short amount of time (in a similar manner to the VS MAX units' jump-jets). The flight systems are powered by the \"BFR capacitor\", which is measured with a small bar on the player's HUD . The capacitor recharges over time when the flight systems are not in use. When a flight variant uses its flight systems, the shields are deactivated for the entire time the BFR is in the air, reactivating once it lands. Additionally, the shield levels will be drained as long as the BFR is in flight. The BFR can remain airborne until the capacitor is drained, then it will begin dropping back to the ground. Flight variants have much less armor and take a larger amount of time to regenerate their shields compared to their gunner counterparts. Conversely, flight variants can run and walk much faster than the ground variants, giving them the ability to flee relatively quickly when under attack. Each empire variant's maximum jump height is different, with the Invader having the highest jump and the Eclipse having the lowest. Empire-specific flight variants The Invader ( Terran Republic ) The Eagle ( New Conglomerate ) The Eclipse ( Vanu Sovereignty ) BFR Certification In order to certify to get a BFR, a pilot must first get a BFR Imprint down in the caverns if the character was created after June 18, 2009. Also, Armored Assault I and Armored Assault II are required to gain the BattleFrame Robotics certification. Anti-Vehicular (AV) pilot weapons come with the basic BFR certification (4 cert points), as well as the two possible gunner weapons (AV and Anti-Infantry (AI)). In order to get AI and Anti-Aircraft pilot weapons, 1 cert point must be spent for each individually. To obtain a flight variant, one must earn the BFR Basic merit , which involves scoring 100 unique kills and then a kill streak of 15 with the BFR pilot weapons. BFR timers take 25 minutes from the time of original purchase until another BFR can be acquired. The timer is reduced to 15 minutes if a Vehicle Module is installed, or the base is receiving a Cavern Lock Benefit.

Additionally, the shield levels will be drained as long as the BFR is in flight. The BFR can remain airborne until the capacitor is drained, then it will begin dropping back to the ground. Flight variants have much less armor and take a larger amount of time to regenerate their shields compared to their gunner counterparts. Conversely, flight variants can run and walk much faster than the ground variants, giving them the ability to flee relatively quickly when under attack. Each empire variant's maximum jump height is different, with the Invader having the highest jump and the Eclipse having the lowest.","title":"Flight variants"},{"location":"BattleFrame_Robotics/#empire-specific-flight-variants","text":"The Invader ( Terran Republic ) The Eagle ( New Conglomerate ) The Eclipse ( Vanu Sovereignty )","title":"Empire-specific flight variants"},{"location":"BattleFrame_Robotics/#bfr-certification","text":"In order to certify to get a BFR, a pilot must first get a BFR Imprint down in the caverns if the character was created after June 18, 2009.

When enough experience is accumulated, the character will increase in Battle Rank . There are four principle ways to earn Battle Experience Points: Kills : Killing enemies earns experience, based on how long they have been alive (longer equals more BEP, although there is a cap) and what sort of armor/vehicles they are using (bigger equals more BEP). A trooper fresh out of the respawn tube who hasn't had time to equip anything is worth 1 BEP, whereas a Gunner Variant BFR who has been active for an hour or more can be worth at least 2500 BEP. This BEP is awarded to the soldier who got the kill shot, regardless of how much damage he or she may have done prior to the kill. Members of the killing soldier's squad who are in the same Zone also receive a percentage of the BEP awarded for the kill, modified by their proximity to the Experience waypoint . Kills made by a gunner in a vehicle you are driving will also earn you experience (driver and all gunners share the experience, but not passengers), whether you are in a Squad together or not. Facility Captures : The formula used to calculate this amount is complex, and is based on how many unique enemies and squadmates were within the SOI during the ten minutes prior to and during the hack itself and for how long. This figure caps at 2250 BEP per capture. See this link for a more detailed explaination. Training : Experimenting with new things earns experience. Usually only relevant to very new soldiers, any object with a hovering gold/yellow exclamation mark logo above it will generate a pop-up window explanation and some BEP upon closer inspection. This rarely goes over 200 BEP a time, but can be helpful at early stages. These pop-ups are awarded for many things, including visiting a continent for the first time, using a looted gun for the first time, discovering Monoliths and so on, but are only ever awarded once. (See the Character Info 'Training' tab to keep track of these.) ANT Runs : A soldier successfully refueling a facility using an Advanced Nanite Transport (or BFR NTU Siphon ) earns experience. The experience gained varies depending how much NTU the base requires to reach 100% capacity, and is rationed out to the ANT owner in 20 BEP ticks during refueling. Squad mates within the same zone also receive 20 BEP for each tick. Note: You will only receive BEP for filling up a neutral base if it has a friendly hack on it.

Press \u201cP\u201d, click the \u201cFind Squad\u201d tab, double click on a listed squad, then click \u201cJoin Squad.\u201d Certifications Your character has limited access to weapons, equipment, and vehicles by what your character is certified in. Each certification costs a certain amount of points. Characters start with seven certification points. New characters already have these certification points spent, so it is recommended that you go to a Certification Terminal in your empire\u2019s Sanctuary or Bio Laboratory facilities. In PlanetSide with current populations, vehicle certifications usefulness are diminished since most fights take place indoors where vehicles have virtually zero impact. I will list exceptions to this rule later. How to repair your armor and heal yourself The certifications of Engineering and Medical are convenient for repairing your armor and healing yourself respectively. However, newer characters may not always have access to these certifications. There are very valid workarounds, although they typically Fortunately, most of the combat in PlanetSide with current populations revolve around battling near Equipment Terminals. To repair your armor without Engineering (regular armor, not MAX or Infiltration Suit): Go to an Equipment Terminal Choose a loadout of a different armor type you are currently wearing Choose the loadout of the armor type you were wearing (Hotkey process: G \u2192 # \u2192 G \u2192 #) This will repair your armor to full. Be warned, if you change loadouts to the armor type you were wearing, the armor will not be healed. To repair your armor while in a MAX If you are in a MAX suit, you can repair your armor by going to a Medical Terminal. It may be more convenient in the heat of battle to have a player repair you. You can inform nearby players that you need repairs by using a voice macro. (Keys: V-N-R). One very useful tip/trick, if you standing directly behind someone at point blank range, they can repair you. This is extremely useful if that player is third person camping. It is important to note that not all players will know about this trick. To heal yourself without Medical/Medical Applicator Not having Medical is less convenient than not having Engineering. The reason for this is Medkits, one of the few pieces of equipment that everyone has access to, regardless of their certifications. Medkits can be used to heal yourself for 25 health every 5 seconds. They are useful and in the thick of battle because they essentially increase your effective health -- they are instant cast and don\u2019t require any weapon change. **For this reason, I recommend switching the Medkit hotkey to a button that is easy to hit, other than the default of F1. Personally, I use Right Click so I don\u2019t have to move my keyboard hand (responsible for movement in fights) to press it. Medkits can be useful out of combat when you don\u2019t have Medical or don\u2019t have a Medical Applicator. Typical Reinforced Exosuit loadouts contain 2-4 Medkits. If you don\u2019t have Medical, and/or access to many certifications such as Anti-Vehicular, you can often times make room for more. For instance, I have a specific loadout that contains 8 Medkits in Reinforced Exosuit. Typical Agile Exosuit loadouts contain 1-3 Medkits, depending whether or not you take a Decimator or not, and if you take extra hand grenades. In downtime between fighting, make your way to an equipment terminal. One of the main advantages of Medical is that you can heal yourself with a lot more inventory efficiency than with Medkits, and that you don\u2019t waste Medkits for downtime instead of fighting. However, since most fights take place near Equipment Terminals in current day PlanetSide, this advantage is mostly negated. Take as many opportunities as possible in downtime to return to Equipment Terminals and replenish your loadout with Medkits, as well as using the armor swap trick to repair your armor. These two methods will make the lack of Engineering and Medical certifications much less painful. Combat There are a few important aspects to combat in PlanetSide that are important to learn about as a beginner. Movement/Strafing Strafing is an important part of infantry combat. In this game, strafe movement is quicker compared to other games in the FPS genre, so you can help mitigate damage through good movement. Strafing side to side (A-D-A-D) for approximately one second in each direction is a sweet spot that can create a rubber-banding or \u2018warping\u2019 effect that can throw off an enemy\u2019s aim. Sometimes you\u2019ll want to take a longer strafe and throw the warping strafe in to throw off an enemy. The more unpredictable your movement (while simultaneously integrating the warping strafe) the better. Agile ExoSuit moves and strafes faster, so this effect can be more prominent when using it. Additionally, you can more easily execute circle strafing or flanking maneuvers. However, it requires some pretty good skill and game sense to do so. Third Person/Camping Since there is a third person mode that allows you to see around corners (albeit not aim), many players will camp corners to gain advantages in combat, waiting for unsuspecting troops to push forward. While it\u2019s not always a guaranteed kill, it benefits the defender greatly in a lot of cases (particularly 1v1 situations). If you are uncertain if an enemy is around a corner, throw a hand grenade at it to determine if an enemy is there or not. If the cone of fire appears, then you hit something. Boomers (Spawned through Combat Engineering\u2019s ACE Device) are very deadly remote controlled mines used primarily indoors by third person campers to get an instant kill on enemy infantry or do heavy damage to MAX units. You can use third person to check corners in a hostile area before you proceed. If you spot a boomer (a gold, triangle shaped mine), you can throw a Jammer grenade around the corner to destroy it. Boomers are often a newbie trap, but using this technique will highly mitigate their threat. Radar Your minimap in game displays the location of friendly and enemy players, MAXs, and vehicles. Friendly are green -- enemy are red. Radar viruses can influence this sometimes, but they are typically rare. It\u2019s important to keep an eye on red dots and bracket looking blips while indoors. If your base has Interlink benefits, you can see enemies if they are moving (running) while not crouched or walking. You can also get a similar effect from using the Audio Amplification Implant, which should typically be your first or second Implant pickup. This is an important part of the game that many people utilize to their advantage. It is important you do so as well.

A REK is needed to hack doors and Control Consoles. Additionally, it is needed to hack Equipment Terminals with Advanced Hacking. If you don\u2019t have one, you can find yourself stuck outside an enemy base or unable to hack an enemy Control Console! If you are a new character who lacks the Anti-Vehicular certification, it is recommended that you bring some Gold Ammo (Armor Piercing) boxes into your loadout to help deal with MAX Units. Newer players with less certifications will probably be more interested in the alternative loadouts requiring less certifications. NOTE: These are the Terran Republic versions of loadouts. New Conglomerate and Vanu Sovereignty will have to use their equivalent empire specific weapons and respective ammo.

When you do end up dying, the spawn screen will appear. This consists of usually two or three respawn points. This would be the closest Tower, Facility, and Advanced Mobile Station (AMS) if available. You have to wait a certain amount of time based on your number of deaths before respawning. This ranges anywhere between one second and one minute. When the timer ends, you materialize in a respawn tube. If you don\u2019t like where you have spawned or wish to respawn somewhere else, go into the Respawn Tube and press \u201cG\u201d to deconstruct your avatar. On the AMS, the respawn tube is located at the back of the vehicle. Scattered throughout the facilities are Matrixing Panels. By hitting \u201cG\u201d you bind yourself at that facility. An AMS will have a Matrix Panel as well, and is located on the very front of the vehicle. Binding at a facility will let you respawn at that facility, even if it isn\u2019t the closest. You can only be bound to one facility and one AMS at a time. Advanced Mobile Station (AMS) The AMS is a vehicle that serves as a mobile spawn point. It also features a Matrixing Panel at the front and two Equipment Terminals on either side. If you wish to deconstruct yourself, you can do so by going to the rear end of the AMS. The AMS can be acquired from a Vehicle Terminal by certing Ground Support. NOTE: When populations are extremely low, it is sometimes considered unethical to camp or destroy spawns, particularly an AMS. The reason for this is that it kills the fight for a while, leading to meaningless downtime. This isn\u2019t a problem when the game has enough players to work correctly from a design perspective. However, when populations are extremely low, sometimes it\u2019s considered bad etiquette to do so.

In the right situations, my bombardier has made over 60 kills before we died. In other situations you will die before you even make it to the target. This guide is intended to help both the pilot and bombardier be successful and stay alive while bombing. I will note that many pilots will tell you something completely opposite of what I put in this guide. There might well be better tactics out there that work in certain situations, but I have the Bomber Ace Auraxium merit and this is what has worked for me. Liberator and Vulture Properties Liberator The Liberator is the most used bomber and is available to anyone with the Air Support certification . The nose gun is a powerful 35mm Chaingun that shreds every type of target from infantry to armor to aircraft. The bomber seat can drop two types of bombs: Anti-Infantry cluster bombs and Anti-Armor tank buster bombs. The tailgun fires powerful 25mm rounds that are good on a variety of targets, though best used for fending off enemy aircraft. The Liberator lacks an afterburner, but can hold one more box of ammunition than the Vulture in its trunk . Vulture The Vulture is a specialized bomber available to those who have the Air Support certification and also the Bomber Ace Bronze Merit Commendation . The nosegun of the vulture used the same 35mm Chaingun Bullets as the Liberator, but fires them more rapidly. The trade-off is the damage per shot is much lower and takes a very long time (>5 sec) to reload. The bomber seat can drop only Anti-Armor bombs and lacks the cluster bombs of the Liberator. These bombs do almost double the damage to armor as their liberator counterparts, but fall more slowly and are released more slowly. This means it's more difficult to get enough bombs on a heavily armored target to kill it before you pass over. The Vulture has a higher top speed than the Liberator and has an afterburner. It can also release bombs from a lower altitude than the Liberator. General Bombing Tactics There are two generic bombing tactics that most pilots follow: Low altitude bombing and high altitude bombing. Each has their advantages and disadvantages as will be discussed. Low Altitude Bombing I generally favor this tactic 90% of the time. I find it gets more kills than high altitude most of the time and your survival rate is higher as long as there is cover nearby. For low altitude bombing you want to fly as low as possible to the ground to avoid being seen by the enemy. You want to fly just high enough as to not set off any mines on the ground. Approach your target from the flanks or rear. You only want to take enemy fire on your exit and not your entrance. As you approach, gain enough height so that the bombing icon is illuminated and level out. After you pass the target (and hopefully destroyed it), dive back down the previous altitude. Get to know each base terrain and plan your flight path accordingly. Flying behind terrain and trees will break lock-on weapons. Find a safe place to land, repair, and repeat the process. If you are doing low-altitude bombing, you generally do NOT need to take a tailgunner with you. The tailgunner will have little to shoot at and even if an enemy aircraft starts shooting at you, you will be so low to the ground that the tailgunner will not be able to shoot up high enough to hit the target. Know where friendly anti-air MAXes are and retreat to them if you are under air attack. High Altitude Bombing I personally rarely use this tactic, but in some cases it works better than low-altitude. You will generally get less kills from higher altitude as the enemy will see the bombs on their radar for many seconds before impact and have plenty of time to run away. However, high altitude exposes you to enemy fire for less periods of time generally as they don't always see or notice you up there until you start dropping bombs. I use this tactic when the enemy is clumped up on a bridge as they have nowhere to run except to drown. I also use it if the enemy base is at a low altitude and I'm fighting flak weapons ( Wall Turrets and TR Burster MAXes . You're fairly safe from flak at high altitude unless you fly very predictably and the enemy has great skill. Again you will want to approach from the side or rear so that the enemy isn't looking in your direction. Climb to maximum altitude ALWAYS. Never bomb from a medium altitude as you are easily visible and have no place to run or hide. I sometimes find it handy to place a personal waypoint on the target as it's difficult to see the ground from high altitude. After your bomber drops its bombs, turn sharply in some direction. This will make it very difficult for flak to hit you. Change directions randomly every 5 seconds or so if you're taking heavy flak fire and go to the ground to repair. Never fly in a straight line away from flak weapons. If you took little or no damage, feel free to turn around and make another pass. I highly recommend taking a tailgunner along for high altitude runs. You will almost always attract enemy aircraft. Always fly at flight ceiling so that the enemy cannot get above your tailgunner's line of fire. If you are in the middle of nowhere and there is no threat from the ground, STOP the aircraft, point the nose down as far as you can, and keep the tail pointed towards the enemy aircraft by looking at your minimap. This will generally close the distance between you and the enemy, making your tailgunner land more shots and hopefully destroy it quicker. If you don't do this, the aircraft will just stay at maximum distance and take pot-shots at you all day until you die. Of course, if you know you are near friendly anti-air units, you always have the option of running to them as well. Lining up Targets If you don't put the target under you bombardier's sights, you obviously won't get any kills. This is your most important job. The most helpful keymap you can make it to make the \"reset controls\" option (default alt-r) to something easily accessible. I have it mapped to a mouse button. If you want to make 100% sure you are level and your bombardier can drop bombs, use this button liberally, as it will auto-level your bomber. This is especially useful when you are coming out of a steep turn or ascent. Take note of the black vertical line in the pilot seat. This is the bombing line. The bottom end of the line is what the bombardier's sites will pass over. You can affect this line by strafing left and right. I find strafing very useful. As you pass over a clump of infantry, strafe left and right a little bit. This will spread your bombs out perpendicular to your travel direction, giving your bomber much more area to saturate in bombs and making it less likely that someone can dodge your pass. Generally, you want to avoid trying to bomb moving vehicles . But you can always try. Make sure to lead them enough. You will have to lead them much more than you think, and your bombardier needs to understand how to do this too for a successful kill. You should be glancing at your mini-map every 2-3 seconds. If you fly directly over an AMS, it will show on the radar, alerting you to make another pass. The radar will also allow you to line targets up better and know where enemy aircraft are. Standard Targets Your bread and butter targets are generally ridges and base walls. Ridges are routinely saturated with players if it overlooks a base, providing cover for snipers and anti-vehicular users, and even armor. This can yield many kills while always providing decent cover to run to on the other side of the ridge. The other great target are walls of bases. On the attack, the wall facing the tower is the most populated if your empire owns the tower. Line up the wall running down its length and lets the bombs fly on unsuspecting snipers. Wall Turrets can be the most difficult of targets to destroy. Many times your bombardier will overshoot the target, making the bombs land past the target on the ground. To minimize this risk, it's best to line up wall turrets so that you pass directly over the stairs leading up to them (or the place where you might get in for tower turrets). Placing bombs right on the stairs instead of trying to put them directly on the turret will maximize your chances of damaging or killing it. Make sure you tell your bomber this information as well. Avoiding Enemy Fire I've already talked about how to avoid flak fire. Never fly in a straight line when taking flak fire and try to find some cover to break the line of sight. Against the Sparrow MAX, you need to fly a little differently. If you find Sparrow missiles following you, find terrain to hide behind immediately. Even a small hole will do sometimes. Dip down and STOP in the hole briefly. Wait until all the missiles have hit the ground around you, then continue. If you hadn't stopped, you might have avoided one or two missiles, but the rest would still have followed and hit you. Against a Striker or Starfire you can either find a tree or terrain to break the lock, or simply fly out of its effective range (250m for the striker, 350m for the Starfire). If you are flying directly away from them at the same altitude, be sure to turn slightly as you reach the maximum effective range, as the missiles will still follow their previous path and may hit you if you don't change direction slightly. Against a Wasp and you are flying low, fly through trees as much as possible to break the lock. Flying inside an Aegis Shield Generator will also break the lock, but you will likely give away its position, so use wisely. At altitude, you have less options. Fly towards friendly anti-air units. If you have a tailgunner, your best bet is to stop the aircraft and point the tail to the wasp, as described earlier. Liberator or Vulture? When you first get your shinny new Vulture, you will be tempted to use it a lot. The sad truth is the Vulture is inferior to the Liberator in almost every way, even though it is supposed to be an upgrade. While the vulture bombs do more damage, they have a smaller splash radius, fall slower, and release much slower. It also takes twice as long to reload a clip. I use the Liberator in almost all cases, however there are circumstances in which the Vulture is actually the better choice. I use the vulture in situations where anti-air cover is high and I want to fly low. With the vulture, you can come in, drop some bombs, then afterburn away to safety. You won't get as many kills with the Vulture, but you will live more, so there is a trade-off that you will have to balance. The tactics with the Vulture is almost identical to that of the Liberator. However, you generally want to avoid flying high-altitude missions with the Vulture as it takes forever for the bombs to reach the ground. The biggest difference is that you need to slow down over a target to allow enough bombs to be dropped to kill it. You can then quickly accelerate by afterburning away to safety. Due to the small splash radius, you must really fly directly over the target. A Vulture bomb will only kill a soldier wearing Rexo armor if it lands within 1-2 meters of him. Which Bombs to Use This is obviously something the bombardier selects, but if he or she is not picking the right bombs for the situation, you need to inform him. The Vulture can only drop AV bombs, so there's no problem there. The Liberator, however, can drop cluster bombs or tank buster bombs. The cluster bombs spread out into 9 bomblets in a 3x3 grid pattern, while the tank buster bombs simply drop to the ground with one big explosion. Cluster bombs do less damage, but do the same full damage over a large area. The tank buster bombs do more damage, but the damage falls off over a relatively short distance away from the impact. Use cluster bombs on large groups of infantry. It will take two bombs to kill most infantry. Works best if you strafe as discussed before to spread out the damage. The main use of cluster bombs are on BFRs . Yes it sounds strange, but cluster bombs actually do more damage to a BFR if its shields are up than a tank buster bomb does. It also has a higher probability of damaging critical systems. However, if the BFR has no shields, it's best to use tank buster bombs. Tank buster bombs should be used the majority of the time. It kills infantry in one hit if reasonably close and does great damage to vehicles. If you don't get anything else out of this guide, please USE TANK BUSTER BOMBS ON MAX UNITS! It takes two tank buster bombs to kill a MAX while taking 8 cluster bombs. Nothing annoys me more than my bomber dropping cluster bombs on an anti-air MAX only for it to live and shoot us down after we pass. These bombs should also be used in proximity to doors as the splash damage will kill enemies inside the door while cluster bombs will not. Also use tank buster bombs in heavily forested areas as cluster bombs will sometimes explode at tree top level, rendering them useless. Of course, tank buster bombs should be used on all forms of vehicles, except BFRs , as discussed earlier. Bombardier Information Drop bombs on the enemy right? Well it's not always that simple. Dropping all 10 bombs on the first target you see and then having to reload when you pass over a cluster of 15 troops will make you and the pilot mad. Always look as far forward as possible to spot highly concentrated targets and save the majority of your bombs for that if you don't think you can reload in time. And as I've already mentioned, use tank buster bombs on MAXes! Not every bombardier realizes that you can aim your bombs a little. By moving your mouse up and down you can change the location of the crosshair and that's where the bombs will land. In level flight at full throttle, you should be able to land all 10 bombs on a single point. When bombing targets at the top of a hill, aim a little on the downslope closest to you to ensure you will hit it. It's embarrassing to watch all 10 bombs fly over the vanguard you were targeting and go down the mountain, missing completely. The crosshair is accurate most of the time, but don't always trust it, especially on steep slopes.

I highly recommend taking a tailgunner along for high altitude runs. You will almost always attract enemy aircraft. Always fly at flight ceiling so that the enemy cannot get above your tailgunner's line of fire. If you are in the middle of nowhere and there is no threat from the ground, STOP the aircraft, point the nose down as far as you can, and keep the tail pointed towards the enemy aircraft by looking at your minimap. This will generally close the distance between you and the enemy, making your tailgunner land more shots and hopefully destroy it quicker. If you don't do this, the aircraft will just stay at maximum distance and take pot-shots at you all day until you die. Of course, if you know you are near friendly anti-air units, you always have the option of running to them as well.","title":"High Altitude Bombing"},{"location":"Bombing_Guide_by_Quovatis/#lining-up-targets","text":"If you don't put the target under you bombardier's sights, you obviously won't get any kills. This is your most important job. The most helpful keymap you can make it to make the \"reset controls\" option (default alt-r) to something easily accessible. I have it mapped to a mouse button. If you want to make 100% sure you are level and your bombardier can drop bombs, use this button liberally, as it will auto-level your bomber. This is especially useful when you are coming out of a steep turn or ascent. Take note of the black vertical line in the pilot seat. This is the bombing line. The bottom end of the line is what the bombardier's sites will pass over. You can affect this line by strafing left and right. I find strafing very useful. As you pass over a clump of infantry, strafe left and right a little bit. This will spread your bombs out perpendicular to your travel direction, giving your bomber much more area to saturate in bombs and making it less likely that someone can dodge your pass. Generally, you want to avoid trying to bomb moving vehicles . But you can always try. Make sure to lead them enough. You will have to lead them much more than you think, and your bombardier needs to understand how to do this too for a successful kill. You should be glancing at your mini-map every 2-3 seconds. If you fly directly over an AMS, it will show on the radar, alerting you to make another pass. The radar will also allow you to line targets up better and know where enemy aircraft are.","title":"Lining up Targets"},{"location":"Bombing_Guide_by_Quovatis/#standard-targets","text":"Your bread and butter targets are generally ridges and base walls. Ridges are routinely saturated with players if it overlooks a base, providing cover for snipers and anti-vehicular users, and even armor. This can yield many kills while always providing decent cover to run to on the other side of the ridge. The other great target are walls of bases. On the attack, the wall facing the tower is the most populated if your empire owns the tower. Line up the wall running down its length and lets the bombs fly on unsuspecting snipers. Wall Turrets can be the most difficult of targets to destroy. Many times your bombardier will overshoot the target, making the bombs land past the target on the ground. To minimize this risk, it's best to line up wall turrets so that you pass directly over the stairs leading up to them (or the place where you might get in for tower turrets). Placing bombs right on the stairs instead of trying to put them directly on the turret will maximize your chances of damaging or killing it. Make sure you tell your bomber this information as well.","title":"Standard Targets"},{"location":"Bombing_Guide_by_Quovatis/#avoiding-enemy-fire","text":"I've already talked about how to avoid flak fire. Never fly in a straight line when taking flak fire and try to find some cover to break the line of sight. Against the Sparrow MAX, you need to fly a little differently. If you find Sparrow missiles following you, find terrain to hide behind immediately. Even a small hole will do sometimes. Dip down and STOP in the hole briefly. Wait until all the missiles have hit the ground around you, then continue. If you hadn't stopped, you might have avoided one or two missiles, but the rest would still have followed and hit you. Against a Striker or Starfire you can either find a tree or terrain to break the lock, or simply fly out of its effective range (250m for the striker, 350m for the Starfire). If you are flying directly away from them at the same altitude, be sure to turn slightly as you reach the maximum effective range, as the missiles will still follow their previous path and may hit you if you don't change direction slightly. Against a Wasp and you are flying low, fly through trees as much as possible to break the lock. Flying inside an Aegis Shield Generator will also break the lock, but you will likely give away its position, so use wisely. At altitude, you have less options. Fly towards friendly anti-air units. If you have a tailgunner, your best bet is to stop the aircraft and point the tail to the wasp, as described earlier.","title":"Avoiding Enemy Fire"},{"location":"Bombing_Guide_by_Quovatis/#liberator-or-vulture","text":"When you first get your shinny new Vulture, you will be tempted to use it a lot. The sad truth is the Vulture is inferior to the Liberator in almost every way, even though it is supposed to be an upgrade. While the vulture bombs do more damage, they have a smaller splash radius, fall slower, and release much slower. It also takes twice as long to reload a clip. I use the Liberator in almost all cases, however there are circumstances in which the Vulture is actually the better choice. I use the vulture in situations where anti-air cover is high and I want to fly low. With the vulture, you can come in, drop some bombs, then afterburn away to safety. You won't get as many kills with the Vulture, but you will live more, so there is a trade-off that you will have to balance. The tactics with the Vulture is almost identical to that of the Liberator. However, you generally want to avoid flying high-altitude missions with the Vulture as it takes forever for the bombs to reach the ground. The biggest difference is that you need to slow down over a target to allow enough bombs to be dropped to kill it. You can then quickly accelerate by afterburning away to safety. Due to the small splash radius, you must really fly directly over the target. A Vulture bomb will only kill a soldier wearing Rexo armor if it lands within 1-2 meters of him.","title":"Liberator or Vulture?"},{"location":"Bombing_Guide_by_Quovatis/#which-bombs-to-use","text":"This is obviously something the bombardier selects, but if he or she is not picking the right bombs for the situation, you need to inform him. The Vulture can only drop AV bombs, so there's no problem there. The Liberator, however, can drop cluster bombs or tank buster bombs. The cluster bombs spread out into 9 bomblets in a 3x3 grid pattern, while the tank buster bombs simply drop to the ground with one big explosion. Cluster bombs do less damage, but do the same full damage over a large area. The tank buster bombs do more damage, but the damage falls off over a relatively short distance away from the impact. Use cluster bombs on large groups of infantry. It will take two bombs to kill most infantry. Works best if you strafe as discussed before to spread out the damage. The main use of cluster bombs are on BFRs . Yes it sounds strange, but cluster bombs actually do more damage to a BFR if its shields are up than a tank buster bomb does. It also has a higher probability of damaging critical systems. However, if the BFR has no shields, it's best to use tank buster bombs. Tank buster bombs should be used the majority of the time. It kills infantry in one hit if reasonably close and does great damage to vehicles. If you don't get anything else out of this guide, please USE TANK BUSTER BOMBS ON MAX UNITS! It takes two tank buster bombs to kill a MAX while taking 8 cluster bombs. Nothing annoys me more than my bomber dropping cluster bombs on an anti-air MAX only for it to live and shoot us down after we pass. These bombs should also be used in proximity to doors as the splash damage will kill enemies inside the door while cluster bombs will not. Also use tank buster bombs in heavily forested areas as cluster bombs will sometimes explode at tree top level, rendering them useless. Of course, tank buster bombs should be used on all forms of vehicles, except BFRs , as discussed earlier.","title":"Which Bombs to Use"},{"location":"Bombing_Guide_by_Quovatis/#bombardier-information","text":"Drop bombs on the enemy right? Well it's not always that simple. Dropping all 10 bombs on the first target you see and then having to reload when you pass over a cluster of 15 troops will make you and the pilot mad. Always look as far forward as possible to spot highly concentrated targets and save the majority of your bombs for that if you don't think you can reload in time. And as I've already mentioned, use tank buster bombs on MAXes! Not every bombardier realizes that you can aim your bombs a little. By moving your mouse up and down you can change the location of the crosshair and that's where the bombs will land. In level flight at full throttle, you should be able to land all 10 bombs on a single point. When bombing targets at the top of a hill, aim a little on the downslope closest to you to ensure you will hit it. It's embarrassing to watch all 10 bombs fly over the vanguard you were targeting and go down the mountain, missing completely. The crosshair is accurate most of the time, but don't always trust it, especially on steep slopes.

Though the mechanics of a base capture are simple, there's a lot of different ways you can do it. The Goal: Hack the CC When you are attacking a base the ultimate goal will be to hack the Control Console of the facility and secure the control console. You must keep control of the CC until either the 15 minute capture timer runs, or in the case of an LLU base, the LLU is delivered. It takes 20 seconds for an advanced hacker to control a CC, so you must be sure that the CC is never insecure for more than 20 seconds. Furthermore, when you are attempting to stop an enemy from taking your base, remember that once it gets down to that 20 second mark, they will get the base, so it's time to change from defense to offense at that base. Securing the hack Ultimately, control of a base comes down to controlling spawn points . If you can spawn at a base and the enemy cannot, you will win most of the time. It is possible for well coordinated forces to retake a CC without having a nearby spawn point but it is far more difficult to do so. There are three types of spawn points to consider in this situation: AMS Towers Base spawn tubes Base Spawn Tubes Generally speaking, the closer a spawn is to the CC, the more dangerous it is going to be for you. The base spawns, being inside the base, are obviously the greatest threat to a successful base capture. To shut down the base spawns you can either destroy the individual tubes or destroy the generator . A tube can be destroyed with one boomer, three decimators, or a number of other combinations of weapons. Armor piercing and AV weapons are going to be best suited to destroying tubes. The tubes, though easily destroyed, are also easily repaired. An engineer need only repair one tube half way to permit forces to spawn at the base. So another tactic is to destroy the generator. A destroyed generator is more difficult to recover from because it not only shuts down the spawn but also all equipment terminals. It also takes more effort to repair a damaged generator. The side-effect of taking down a gen though is that, as the attacker, you also lose the ability to make use of the equipment terminals at the base. Destroying generators should usually be avoided except as a last resort. You should never destroy the generator of a base that is your first link into a continent. This will leave you with no ability to spawn vehicles on the continent. Towers Towers , though usually a good distance from the base, are dangerous because of two factors: MAX units can be obtained at them Towers are indestructible AMS's Though AMS's can be destroyed, unlike a tower, it requires that somebody be able to get outdoors with the proper gear to do it. In a heated battle with many enemies spawning close to the base, this may not be possible.

Any round you fire will go randomly inside that cone. The following things affect your Cone of Fire : Crouching (narrows) Moving (expands) Taking damage (expands) Continuous fire (expands) Jumping (expands) Some weapons always have a very narrow Cone of Fire (for example, the Mosquito 's 12mm gun) while others expand quite a bit.

Accessed by pressing the \"M\" key (default). To zoom the map, use the Mouse Wheel, and to move it, left-click-hold, and drag. Press 'G' to move to the Interstellar Map . Basic Map View The basic view (by default: \"M\") shows the continent as a whole. The features of the basic view are as follows: Facility Information Base Name --Every Facility in the game has a unique name, typically based on mythological figures from history. Base Type --On either side of the facility name will be a clock icon (indicating Hack-and-Hold base type) or flag icons (indicating an LLU base type). Hack Status --If the facility is under hack, crossed flags of the empire initiating the hack will appear to the left of the facility name. Facility Linked Benefit --Above the base name will be various icons indicating the linked benefits the facility is receiving ( see Facility Linked Benefit for more information ). Module Status --If the base is receiving a Module benefit a yellow module icon will appear next to the name. It will be green if the module benefit is a Cavern Lock . Generator Status --If the facility's Generator is destroyed a lightning bolt with a cross through it will appear as an icon next to the name. Spawn Tube Status --If all of the facility's Spawn Tubes are destroyed, a crossed-out spawn tube icon will appear next to the name. Boosted Pain Field Status --If the generator or Spawn Room has had its Pain Field boosted, special icons will be displayed next to the name. Base NTU Levels --The current reserves of base NTU are displayed as a percentage below the base name. Generally, a Base will only consume large amounts of NTU if its equipment has been destroyed, so this can be an indication that enemy troops are operating in the structure. Tower Information Tower Names -- Tower names are unique to each Planet , and generally reflect the tower type, and the nearest other features of note; e.g 'SE Lahar Watch Tower' Tower Spawn Tube Status --If both of the tower's spawn tubes are destroyed, a special icon will appear under the tower name. The icon will only appear if you are zoomed in close enough. Latice Information Lattice Links --Each base is connected to its neighbours by the Lattice , and this is represented on the map by connecting lines in various colors, indicating oppotunities to hack. See Lattice for more information on the colors. Capitol Links and Force Dome Status --Connections between Capitols and their Sub-Capitols are shown by green Lattice Links, and the status of the Capitol Force Dome can be seen by a pale outline around the structure of the Capitol on the map. SOI Locations Base SOI --The Sphere of Influence of a base is indicated by a large circle on the map in the color of the owning empire. The area covered by this circle has many special rules associated with it, and many deployables have SOI restrictions. Tower SOIs --Towers also have an SOI , although it is a lot smaller. Where a Tower and Base SOI overlap, your empire 's SOI takes priority. Warpgate Information Warpgate Location -- Warpgates are shown on the map as green-yellow circles. Lattice links pass through these warpgates, to connect to the first base on the destination Planet. The destination of the warpgate is also shown if it is not a Broadcast warpgate . Sanctuary Warpgates --Sanctuary Warpgates leading to a Sanctuary are colored accordingly and cannot be entered by enemy troops. Geowarp --Geowarp gates are shown similarly, but smaller, and lead into the indicated Cavern . Geowarps rotate in activity, thus an inactive geoward will be denoted on the map as well. Detailed Facility Information By Double-clicking on a base on the map,a new window will pop up with more details about that base ( Cavern facilities do not have this feature). Base Type --Five base types exist, each having a different layout, and providing different features and benefits; Amp Station , Tech Plant , Bio Laboratory , Interlink Facility , and Dropship Center . Base Capture Type --Bases can be captured in one of two ways; Standard (or 'Hack n Wait'), shown by a pair of clock symbols, or LLU , show by a pair of flag symbols. NTU Level --The ammount of NTU remaining Base Hack Status --If the base is hacked, the hack status will be desplayed here. If it is a hack and hold base, the time remaining until capture will be displayed. Respawn Tube Status --Normal or Destroyed Generator Status --Normal, Critical, or Destroyed Network Status --If the base is infected with a Virus , \"Infected\" is displayed here. If a friendly player installed the virus, the virus type will be shown instead. Base Module Status and Timers --The Base Information Window lists all the currently available Modules , along with their function, how long remains before they run out, and whether they are installed locally, or at a connected lattice base. Base Benefit --Each type of base provides a different Lattice benefit. At the bottom of the window, it shows you what benefits the facility is receiving. Benefits in yellow are a result of Continental lock benefits. Other Information LLU location --An LLU that has been spawned as part of a capture attempt will be displayed cleary on the map for all to see. Its location updates dynamically, as the LLU is moved across the continent, making interception possible. The lactice link that the LLU must move upon will flash. Module Location --As with the LLU, any Modules in transit are shown on the map in a similar manner. Player Location --The player is shown by a white arrow, indicating both position and facing. Squad and Platoon locations --Members of a player's current squad are shown as yellow numbers, corresponding to the numbers in the Squad bar at the top of the screen. Hotspots --Conflict between enemies and friendly troops or deployables is show by yellow flashing stars. This is dynamic, but not continuously updated, the interval being somewhere in the order of 5-10 seconds. Waypoints --A soldier's Personal Waypoint is shown as a white triangular icon. Squad Waypoints are shown as number yellow triangles, with purple and orange, if in a Platoon. The Laze Pointer waypoint is shown as a yellow circle with black arrow. Command Battleplans --At Command Rank 3, Squad Leaders can edit text and draw lines directly on to the Continental Map for the whole Squad to see, in order to elaborate on objectives and tactics. This can look like anything, and is largely dependent on the artistic skill of the Squad Leader. If you see strange things on the map, it is most likely this! Show Friendlies/Enemies --Various Command Ranks gain special abilites to reveal troops. These are shown on this map. Map Grid --The map is overlaid with a basic Map grid reference system, allowing features to be called out quickly with chat text. The letters along the top and numbers down the side make up a co-ordinate; C10, G6, and so on. Deployable Information --Friendly ACE and FDU deployables will show on the map if zoomed in close enough. Each has their own special icon. Special Modes As well as basic navigation, the Continental Map is used in three special situations. Respawn --Upon death, the map allows a soldier to select where to respawn. There are a potential six choices, all shown by spinning cyan circular icons; Nearest AMS, Nearest Tower, Nearest Base, Matrixed Base, Matrixed AMS, Sanctuary. If a spawn point is on another continent, a small inset map will be show to allow selection. HART --The Continental Map is used to allow a soldier dropping from low orbit to pick his desintation. This destination may not be in ANY SOI or on a Enemy Locked Continent, and uses a sort of snap grid system, making prescise dropping tricky. Broadcast Warp --The Continental Map is used to allow the driver of a vehicle, (or infantryman) to select a broadcast Warp destination.

Adding the Auraxian Core Caverns (pre- Bending ) as a playable area, Core Combat adds six distinct cavern environments to maximize tactical potential in the Empire's quests to control Auraxis . In addition to the caverns, new vehicles, weapons and gameplay elements were introduced. When first released, it was required to purchase the expansion to use the new additions, but it is now included for free with an account. Caverns The six cavern areas are: Adlivun Annwn Byblos Drugaskan Hunhau Supai Each cavern is linked to four continental Geowarps , adding new Lattice links to each continent . However, only two caverns are active at any given time, making time a critical factor in cavern attacks and usage of the cavern links. Cavern Base Facilities Down in the caverns, the base facilities are quite different from those that are on the surface. While they are captured just the same, they do not provide the same functions that surface bases to. The cavern facilities were created to facilitate the creation and movement of modules to the surface. Four cavern facility types inhabit the caverns: AT Plant Core Complex - This is a non-capturable facility Module Building Redoubt Building Modules Added to spice up gameplay, one of the new features introduced was the modules . When installed inside a surface base facility, modules grant the facility and the controlling empire certain benefits, depending on the type of module installed. Currently, six types of modules are available to be installed: Equipment Module (blue) Health Module (yellow) Pain Module (beige) Shield Module (aqua) Speed Module (orange) Vehicle Module (purple) In order to obtain a module, one must go to the caverns, capture a Module Building , obtain a non-powered module, and take it to the Core Complex to be charged. Once the module is removed from the Module Building , the player has fifteen minutes to charge the module and bring it to the surface. Once on the surface, the player has an additional fifteen minutes to install the module into a friendly base. Once the module is placed in a Module Cradle , all bases linked to the module will recieve the benefits. Each Empire has a limit to the number of Modules they have have installed at any given time. If exceeded, the only way to gain more modules is to steal them from enemy bases that have them. Crystals Scattered throughout the caverns are multi-colored crystals that provide different benefits depending on the color. All a unit need do is stand next to the crystal to activate it.

They all have a CC, 2 doors each on their roof and ground floor with IFF locks, and a spawn room with tubes, lockers, and equipment terminals. There are three types. Air towers feature two landing pads that Repair/refit.md aircraft, and two wall turrets. Gun towers feature two wall turrets. Watch towers have no guns, but are five stories and feature a middle \u201cbalcony\u201d. Why is it important Any veteran will tell you that holding a facilties tower is a key point to taking the facility. They provide a spawn location near an enemy facility, much like an AMS . A tower, though in a fixed location at the edge of a facilites SOI , has several advantages over an AMS. First off, it has it's own SOI, meaning enemy's can't drop certain CE devices just outside the door. Also, since it's a structure, it can't be destroyed, and protects infantry from OSs and vehicles. One of it's biggest advantages, however, is that it allows access to MAX suits, a feature that the AMS is lacking. Defending First and foremost, CE is key. Place boomers on the inside door, one each, and an alarm near the CC . Heavily mine the outside. Spits and alarms aren\u2019t too useful outside, as vehicles will probably show up early, and then easily destroy them, without taking much damage. Mines, however, will wreak havoc on them. A very deadly combo is a combination of Disruptor Mines and AV . The mines make it so vehicles can't fire their weapons, leaving them open to a salvo of AV rockets. MAXs should set up just inside the door, on the stairs towards the CC. If the people using them have DL , they should activate it. Once the enemy is inside, push hard from the spawn room, and head either to the CC, or keep pushing the enemy outside. If you can bring in vehicles from an outside source, do so, or else enemy vehicles will seal you in. Once they reach the spawn room, try your best to kill them, calling for some CC defence to help (keeping in mind it's probably also under siege). Repair the spawn tubes and terminals as necessary. Also keep an eye out for airdrops on the roof. SA will be really useful in shoving back anyone who comes through the main floor. Just sit on the lower and upper landings, aim at the ground floor, and fire (after making sure it\u2019s clear of friendlies). Standard weaponry is all that\u2019s needed for taking out air droppers. However, despite this, once the tower has troops inside, it\u2019s near impossible to beat them back without outside support. in a heavily forested area, a TRAP may be able to bottleneck people, but in an open space the high influence radius makes it little more then a target. Cerberus turrets placed on the roof/ground may help prevent mossies campers, but will do little to stop droppers and ground forces. Also keep an eye out for phantasm, who can easily drop half a squad onto your roof with no warning. Shadow turrets, however, can make a heavily defended roof appear an easy target, perfect for ambushes on droppers. Attacking Attacking is quite a bit easier. First, bring in vehicles to take out spits and enemy troops, as well as other vehicles. Once you have the outside secured, then set up a vehicle perimeter, and start firing inside once the doors open (until your own side starts going through, of course). If you have the means, drop on top, and attack the CC, forcing the defenders to guard from two angles. Once inside the main floor, try to set up some people to keep the enemy trapped in the basement (MAX\u2019s and SA is really useful), but send the main force to the CC.

They provide a spawn location near an enemy facility, much like an AMS . A tower, though in a fixed location at the edge of a facilites SOI , has several advantages over an AMS. First off, it has it's own SOI, meaning enemy's can't drop certain CE devices just outside the door. Also, since it's a structure, it can't be destroyed, and protects infantry from OSs and vehicles. One of it's biggest advantages, however, is that it allows access to MAX suits, a feature that the AMS is lacking.","title":"Why is it important"},{"location":"DragonJTS/#defending","text":"First and foremost, CE is key. Place boomers on the inside door, one each, and an alarm near the CC . Heavily mine the outside. Spits and alarms aren\u2019t too useful outside, as vehicles will probably show up early, and then easily destroy them, without taking much damage. Mines, however, will wreak havoc on them. A very deadly combo is a combination of Disruptor Mines and AV . The mines make it so vehicles can't fire their weapons, leaving them open to a salvo of AV rockets. MAXs should set up just inside the door, on the stairs towards the CC. If the people using them have DL , they should activate it. Once the enemy is inside, push hard from the spawn room, and head either to the CC, or keep pushing the enemy outside. If you can bring in vehicles from an outside source, do so, or else enemy vehicles will seal you in. Once they reach the spawn room, try your best to kill them, calling for some CC defence to help (keeping in mind it's probably also under siege). Repair the spawn tubes and terminals as necessary. Also keep an eye out for airdrops on the roof. SA will be really useful in shoving back anyone who comes through the main floor. Just sit on the lower and upper landings, aim at the ground floor, and fire (after making sure it\u2019s clear of friendlies). Standard weaponry is all that\u2019s needed for taking out air droppers. However, despite this, once the tower has troops inside, it\u2019s near impossible to beat them back without outside support. in a heavily forested area, a TRAP may be able to bottleneck people, but in an open space the high influence radius makes it little more then a target. Cerberus turrets placed on the roof/ground may help prevent mossies campers, but will do little to stop droppers and ground forces. Also keep an eye out for phantasm, who can easily drop half a squad onto your roof with no warning. Shadow turrets, however, can make a heavily defended roof appear an easy target, perfect for ambushes on droppers.","title":"Defending"},{"location":"DragonJTS/#attacking","text":"Attacking is quite a bit easier. First, bring in vehicles to take out spits and enemy troops, as well as other vehicles. Once you have the outside secured, then set up a vehicle perimeter, and start firing inside once the doors open (until your own side starts going through, of course). If you have the means, drop on top, and attack the CC, forcing the defenders to guard from two angles. Once inside the main floor, try to set up some people to keep the enemy trapped in the basement (MAX\u2019s and SA is really useful), but send the main force to the CC.

Holding down the trigger for roughly two seconds will give you a very lethal full power blast (2-4 shots to kill most infantry plus splash damage and you can even take down a max with 8-10 shots). This is the most ammo efficient way to kill somebody but not necessarily the fastest. If you need to take somebody down quickly, your best bet is to fire a number of more rapid shots. You'll improve your TTK at the expense of some ammo. A good way to get a feel for this is to use the Enhanced Targeting implant. Range The spiker is best suited for use at range. The weapon has significant splash damage making it just as likely that you'll kill yourself when fightin in close quarters. Once you master leading targets it can be an effective sniping weapon because the splash damage makes up for it's innacuracy. An advantage to attacking from a decent range is that you can get all of your shots into the air before the first one hits because of it's slow travel time. This allows you to hold fire and conceal your position before an enemy even knows you are there. Kill whoring and a Thumper in a Bio Laboratory ]] The best way to get lots of kills with a Spiker is to use it in an area where a number of enemies will be clustered together and you will be at a safe distance. The best example of this is the back door of a base. You'll see an enemy running up to the door and you can unleash four full power shots before they even get to the door. They'll be dead before they even know what happened. Vehicle Tactics Vulture The Vulture is a variant of the Liberator and is highly effective at killing vehicles. With the addition of afterburners and major improvements to the maneuverability of the aircraft, it tends to be a far more survivable vehicle. To be as lethal as possible, here are a few strategies to consider when flying. Always Fly Low The Vulture's agility and speed make it most effective as a low altitude bomber. You come in low to the target, pop up over a hill, drop a few bombs, then afterburner to safety. This minimizes your exposure to anti-aircraft fire, and also tends to keep you away from other aircraft which will usually fly higher looking for targets. Another important reason to fly low is that the bombs the vulture releases fall at a very low rate of speed. If you try to bomb a target from higher altitude it can more easily avoid the bombs before they hit the ground. The reason for the bombs falling slowly is that the splash damage would damage your bomber on low altitude runs if it didn't. Be Sneaky A side effect of the slow fall rate of the bombs is they are a bit easier to dodge than Liberator bombs. Thus it is critical to make sure you sneak up on the target. The bests tactic is to circle around a battle and then come in from behind the enemy. The 35MM Cannon The front gun on the vulture is designed to be used for strafing vehicles during a bombing run. It has a high rate of fire but a very long reload time, making it a poor choice for hovering and camping targets. However, it can add quite a bit of damage when combined with the vulture's bomb payload. One thing to beware of is that the cannon can tip off your victim to the fact that they are about to get pounded by your bomber. A full clip fires off in approximately 5 seconds. That's 5 seconds warning time to a driver that's asleep at the wheel. If it's a locked down BFR, you can likely get away with it, but something faster moving may sneak off. Bomb Damage The bombs on the vulture are approximately three times more powerful than that of the Liberator. Thus you can do far more damage in a shorter period of time. Here's what it takes to kill a few common targets. Keep in mind that the splash damage on these bombs is fairly limited so you need to hit directly to achieve these results: Infantry - 1 bomb Max - 2 bombs Lightning - 1+ bomb (1 bomb will take a full health lightning to being disabled) Turrets - 2 bombs Skyguard - 2 bombs Medium Tank (Vanguard, Prowler, Magrider) - 3 bombs FV BFR - 4 bombs (if you can hit it that many times) GV BFR - 5+ bombs Keep in mind that during a typical low altitude bombing run you'll only get 3-4 bombs on a target. So while you can easily kill a turret or a lighter vehicle in one pass, it's a bit hardrer to take down armor and BFR's. Popping up higher can improve your chances of getting more bombs on a target, but also improves their chance to get out of the way. Keep in mind if you get 3 bombs onto a BFR, they will panic because their shields will go down and they'll take some armor damage. A BFR without shields is a sitting duck. So even if you don't kill them on a single pass, they will be effectively taken out of the battle so they can repair and let their shields regenerate.

In this event, one Empire (chosen manually, generally the empire with the highest population at the time) will defend both of their home continents simultaneously in two two-way battles against the other two empires. Below are the times the events will be run on the servers: Werner 11:00 am Pacific Time (7:00 pm UK, -7.00 UTC) Emerald 4:00 pm Pacfic Time (7:00 pm East Coast, -7.00 UTC) Markov 7:00 pm Pacific Time (-7.00 UTC) Preparations for the event should be made ahead of time. There will be a 30 minute warning message before these listed times. This message will announce which empire will be the one defending, and which continents the attacking empires should be on. The battles will begin at the times listed above so make sure you prepare beforehand. The attacker wins by capturing the zone capitol within 3 hours. The defender wins by holding their capitol for this long. Rewards: The winning empire will gain access to the losing empire's vehicles for 48 hours after the attack resolution. Individuals will be secretly chosen for a special event merit. A list of the individual winners will be posted on Monday. However, the merits themselves will not be made available until the next update. Results: Werner Defender : Vanu Sovereignty Terran Republic attacked Verica on Amerish New Conglomerate attacked Eisa on Esamir Outcome: The Vanu Sovereignty defeated the TR. TR and VS both had some very good leadership in the battles here. The New Conglomerate defeated the VS. The VS came within 20 minutes of holding back NC, so close, but the NC has very impressive victories with good leadership. Emerald Defender: Terran Republic New Conglomerate attacked Neit on Forseral Vanu Sovereignty attacked Anguta on Ceryshen Outcome: The New Conglomerate defeated the TR. There were some good fights and some good leadership from NC. The Vanu Sovereignty defeated the TR. VS had some good organization and leadership. There were a couple of good TR leaders as well. Markov Defender: New Conglomerate Outcome: The Terran Republic defeated the NC. The TR started off slow but with good leadership, they ended up with the victory. NC fought really well on this continent as well. The Vanu Sovereignty defeated the NC. The VS were well organized with good leadership. Category:Events","title":"Empire Home Defense Event"},{"location":"Empire_Incentives/","text":"Empire Incentives are awarded and adjusted based upon continental/planetary population. They activate only when the empire with the highest population on the zone has at least 50 players. For each zone, you have experience, spawn timer, and purchase timer bonuses. These only affect the current zone and are based on that zone's population levels. If the dominating empire does not have at least 50 players on the zone, no zone bonuses are given. So for example, if VS have 95% of the zone with 46 players and NC has 5% with 4 players, that single player doesn't get a bonus because VS only have 46 players, which is 4 short of 50! If the dominating empire has over 50 players, then the bonus is calculated from a percentage level based on the ratio between the high empire and your empire. The percentage levels and bonuses are: Fractional Imbalance [Experience](BEP.md) Bonus [Respawn Timer](Respawn_timer.md) Bonus Purchase Timer Bonus 0 - 25% 50% 50% 40% 26 - 50% 30% 35% 30% 51 - 85% 15% 20% 20% 86 - 100% 0% 0% 0% The \"Fractional Imbalance\" = your empire / high empire. So if NC has 150 players, your TR empire has 90 players, and VS has anywhere under 150, you are 90/150 = 60%. You are in the region between 51% and 85%. That means you get 15% experience bonus, 20% faster respawn, and 20% faster purchase timers. This is only on your current zone though! And remember, your world experience bonus is added. So in that example if your zone experience bonus is 15% and your world bonus is 50%, you actually get 65% more experience on that zone. See also: Global Incentives .

It deals a good bit of damage per hit with a tight cone of fire , but small clip size. It also suffers severe Damage Degradation (see graph at right), making it relatively worthless at targets over 50 meters away. In the primary firing mode, it fires as a single shot pistol with a tight cone of fire. The secondary mode fires all remaining rounds quickly with a very large cone of fire. You must have at least 75 stamina to fire the secondary mode. The drawback is that this mode drains all remaining stamina , leaving you vulnerable to attack. Thus, you might want to think twice before firing in this mode. There is a short delay before firing begins with the secondary fire mode (much like the Rocklet Rifle ), with a distinct sound. This can sometimes give your target enough warning to move out of the way. At close range, the Eraser will kill a soldier wearing Rexo armor in 5 shots. The Spear and Stinger function identically.

carries with it a unique benefit for the Empire holding that base. These benefits can be linked to other facilities via the Continental Lattice . A facility can enjoy many benefits from mulitiple bases through direct and indirect chains of links. Facility Linked Benefits, or FLB, can be interupted if the base is hacked by the enemy, if the generator is destroyed, a Virus is uploaded into the Main Terminal , or the base runs out of NTU and goes neutral . Any facility linked to this incapacitated base, directly or via a chain of bases, will lose that base's benefit (except viruses, which affect only the infected base). This system is a similar one used for Cavern Modules . Icons on the Continental Map represent each type of benefit associated or linked to that base. Available Facility Benefits Amp Station - (Benefit icon: Shielded vehicle) Charges the shield generators of vehicles while they are in a friendly Sphere of Influence (SOI) . Shield Generators: Each vehicle has a shield generator installed in it. When they enter an Amp Station's SOI or the SOI of a facility linked to an Amp Station, the shield will begin charging at 5 armor/second up to its maximum strength, which is 20% of the vehicle's base armor. After the shield takes damage, it can recharge again if it is within a friendly SOI though any armor damage done to the vehicle will remain until it is repaired by an Engineer or at a Repair Panel. If a driver takes a shielded vehicle outside of the friendly SOI, the shield will remain, though it will not recharge if it takes any damage until the driver returned to an Amp Station's SOI or any SOI linked to an Amp Station. See Vehicle Armor for a list of vehicle shield strength and the time to fully charge the shield. Bio Laboratory - (Benefit icon: Spawn tube ) Reduces respawn times at friendly linked facilities. Dropship Center - (Benefit icon: Wrench) Enables the Repair ability at Vehicle Repair and Rearm Stations . Rearm and Repair pads and silos provide a quick and easy way for vehicles to repair damage. Each facility is equipped with one or more aircraft landing pads and two ground panels that will perform this function. When a player is in control of a vehicle, they can approach either the pad or panel, depending on whether they are controlling an aircraft or a ground vehicle, and remain stationary to begin the repair process. Aircraft do not need to land on the pad, but they must remain near the pad to be repaired. Similarly, ground vehicles will be repaired automatically if they remain stationary near the Repair and Rearm Panel. Multiple vehicles can use the pads or panels at once. (source: online manual) Replenishment of vehicle ammunition has since become a free feature for all bases, regardless of a link to a Dropship Center. See Repair/Rearm Silo . Note: Ancient Tech Vehicles ( Flail and Switchblade ) require the Vehicle Module benefit to be repaired and/or rearmed, and will not be repaired with the Dropship Center benefit alone. Interlink Facility - (Benefit icon: Radar) Enhanced RADAR abilities at all linked facilities. Facilities linked to an Interlink Facility will gain certain enhancements to their RADAR systems . All enemy vehicles will appear on RADAR, except for deployed Advanced Mobile Stations , Harassers , Mosquitos , and Wasps .

It has fairly high armor but travels at a low speed. The Flail must be deployed , immobilizing it, to fire its devastating long-range energy projectiles. When not deployed it cannot fire its weapon and is therefore defenseless. The vehicle can only deploy on land, though its ability to hover allows it to travel across inland stretches of water, but it cannot travel far beyond the coast of a continent. The farther its projectiles travel, the more damage they do (inverse Damage Degradation ). The Flail works best when supported by a squad leader of Command Rank 1 (CR1) or a squad member utilizing the Laze Pointer to help it acquire a target. Both of these systems give the Flail driver a special triangle shaped target. Unfortunately, squad leader waypoints show the aim zone as it would be if the target was at sea-level while the Laze Pointer, though harder to use, shows the Flail user an aim point which is set to the elevation above sea-level of the target, allowing the Flail user's first shot to hit. A third way of targeting is done by the squad leader assigning the squad experience waypoint (blue diamond) to a particular squad member (done in the \"manage\" tab). An aiming point will be produced for the flail and provides perfect targeting information like the laze pointer . Note however, that you will be targeting the feet of your own squad member! Laze Pointers may be obtained from the Flail itself, as well as all Equipment terminals , and do not require any special Certifications to use. The Flail requires a Vehicle Module lattice benefit, or linked Cavern Lock Benefit in order to be purchasable on the surface.

The round is propelled at high velocity in a fairly straight trajectory until it detects an hostile air target within proximity, upon which it explodes violently, scatering small pieces of shrapnel in a very wide spherical radius, causing large amounts of damage to air vehicle armor. Flak can be tricky to use, as it does not lock on to targets like most other Anti-Air weapon systems, but requires the gunner to anticipate fast moving and distant craft. However, as it does not lock on, the first warning a pilot will get is when the shells begin exploding around them. At this point, unless they are already moving, and have an Afterburner ready, is it generally too late to react to the bombardment. This makes it an ideal choice to ambush hovering aircraft. Most Flak has a maximum range of 500m (exception: Flaklet ) thus it can hit aircraft flying at the 400m ceiling if sufficiently leading the target, although it can cause splash damage if used with 10m or so. Flak is generally ineffective indoors, or against ground vehicles, MAX and infantry, as the shells will not proximity-detonate. Direct hits with the shells causes only minor armor damage to the target. Best used against Mosquitos , Reavers and Wasps , several Flak guns working in concert will generally be required to eliminate Liberators , Lodestars and the Galaxy , by virtue of their large armor, although steady bombardment will generally force a retreat of these craft.

The can take quite some damage before being destroyed, and do serious damage to anything that tries to ram them. For more information see Tactical Resonance Area Protection . Phalanx Wall Turret Upgrades The Fortification Engineering certification allows Engineers to upgrade the Phalanx Wall Turrets at Facilities and Towers. Using the newly designed Upgrade Canister for the Nano Dispenser Wall Turrets can be upgraded with either Anti-Aircraft weaponry or Anti-Vehicular weaponry, besides their default firing method. The Wall Turret must be unmanned, and almost at full health if you want to upgrade the Turret. Upgrading a Turret takes a bit of time, so beware of Enemy fire while upgrading. Once a Turret has been upgraded you can change Weaponry again by repeating the process. Upgrades will last for 30 minutes before reverting to a normal Wall Turret, after it has reverted, it can of course be upgraded again. Turrets will also lose their upgrade if the Facility or Towers get captured by an opposing Empire . Auto-firing Turrets will only use the default firing method, so if you want to use the Upgraded Weaponry, you will have to man the Turret yourself. Aegis Shield Generator Upgrades Once an Assault Engineer has set up an Aegis Shield Generator , Fortification Engineers will be able to upgrade it with certain benefits. The most important benefit is the ability to upgrade the cloaking field with a Shield. To do this, simply \"repair\" the Aegis with a Nano Dispenser equipped with a normal canister, and it will start the upgrade process. The Shield Upgrade has priority over all the other Upgrades that are possible. Once completed, the Aegis will have a Shield protecting it, similar to that of a Facility that has the Shield Module benefit.

Once the Shield Generator reaches zero, it will overload, and explode. The Shield can be recharged if it is below 100% the same way as upgrading the Aegis works. Increased Combat Engineering Deployables With the Fortification Engineering certification you will be able to place additional numbers of Combat Engineering Deployables. The Deployable numbers will be upgraded to: Spitfire Turret : From 10 to 15 Boomer : From 20 to 25 Motion Sensor : From 20 to 25 Heavy Explosive Mine : From 20 to 25 Increased Repair Efficiency Fortification Engineers use Armor Canisters more efficiently, resulting in increased repair efficiency for MAXes (1.5x, from 12 to 18), equipment, and vehicles (2x, from 32 to 64) over that of a standard engineer.

Unlike rockets, after being launched, grenades travel in a ballistic arch. When fired from a Punisher or a Thumper set to primary fire mode, the grenade detonates when it comes into contact with a solid object. When fired from a Thumper set to secondary mode, the grenade detonates after two seconds from the time of launching. This allows the grenade to be bounced off walls or other surfaces to hit targets indirectly. Fragmentation Grenades are effective at damaging infantry as well as armored targets. Furthermore, Fragmentation Grenades have a generous splash damage meaning a direct hit is not required to damage a target. Fragmentation Grenade Packs can also be fired from the Rocklet Rifle . When fired in this manner, the explosive charge travels in a straight line. The charge explodes when it comes into range of an aircraft or reaches its maximum range. If the round comes into contact with any object other than an aircraft, the round will not explode causing very little damage. When used in this manner, the charges are refered to as Flaklets .

Similar to the Continental Lattice , the Galactic Lattice allows Empires to teleport from planet to planet, or to the caverns, via warpgates , broadcast warpgates , and geowarps . The Galactic Lattice is viewable from the Interstellar Map . History of the Galactic Lattice The Galactic Lattice has undergone three major revisions from its original configuration. Launch (May, 2003) Auraxis was originally presented as being a single planet. Each Empire had three home continents, with Searhus being the only continent not directly linked to any Sanctuary . The introduction of Core Combat did not significantly change this, only added the rotating Geowarps in order to provide access to the Caverns. The links between warpgates on each continent are fixed. Except for the HART , there is no way to get to a continent except by moving through any intervening continents. The Bending With \"The Bending\", Auraxis is split up into 13 \"planets\" and six \"asteroids\" on which the continents and caverns now reside. At the same time, the continent of Oshur is broken up into four Battle Islands . It is at this point that the Galactic Lattice came into existence. Additionally, while warpgate connections are generally fixed, if an Empire can capture a continent, all warpgates on that continent will become Broadcast warpgates , providing instant access to continents/planets that are normally several hops away. Additionally, Empires no longer have any home continents, and all warpgates on their Sanctuary are broadcast warpgates. Because of the geometry of connecting the continents, some warpgates became inactive. One Home Planet Due to overwhelming community calls for a \"home turf\" to defend, the Lattice is changed again to give each Empire a single home planet (continent). The functionality for Broadcast warpgates remains essentially the same, but now each Sanctuary is \"hardwired\" to one of the planets. Two Home Planets The Lattice was changed again to its current configuration of two home planets and inter-planet links were again shuffled around. Additionally, the Broadcast Warpgate functionality was changed. Now, instead of needing to hold the Capitol facility on the planet, an Empire needs to control the planetary lattice links between warpgates for them to be broadcast warpgates. This also has a beneficial side effect in allowing zones without Capitols (Oshur Battle Islands, Caverns) to be able to have broadcast warpgates. Home Planet Rotation To give players a change in gameplay, the Lattice was changed once more. All home planets were rotated to a different empire, changing the links to each planet. The Vanu Sovereignty acquired Forseral and Ceryshen , the Terran Republic was granted Solsar and Hossin , and the New Conglomerate was given Amerish and Esamir .

The gunship takes only 75% of all damage incident on it, making its effective armor much stronger than the regular Galaxy without increasing repair time much. The gunship sports three 35mm chainguns and 2 Ground Pounders . It lacks the MAX passenger slots and cargo bay of the original Galaxy. The Galaxy Gunship is a beast on the battlefield, able to take on almost any single target at close to medium range. A single anti-aircraft platform is no match for the gunship. The Galaxy Gunship can only be purchased at a Dropship Center or the Sanctuary . The purchase timer is 10 minutes.

On May 20, 2008, the Markov and Emerald servers combined to form Gemini. On August 25, 2009 Werner was also merged into the Gemini server. Character and Outfit names that were not unique to both Markov and Emerald had a \"-M\" (for Markov) or a \"-E\" (for Emerald), appended to the name if the name did not have priority. The same method was used for the Werner merge with a \"-W\" (for Werner) and a \"-G\" (for Gemini) appended. See the official Markov/Emerald announcement below for information about how name priorities are decided and how to change the character or outfit name if it did not have priority. The same method was used for both the Markov/Emerald and Werner/Gemini merges. Official Announcement With the goal of maintaining a high level of battle between the three Empires of PlanetSide, the two North American servers, Markov and Emerald, will be merged into one server on May 20, 2008. The new server will be named Gemini to represent the two long standing servers. When the merge occurs, characters will be given a special merit to represent their loyalty to their former server. Native Markov characters will receive a different merit than their Emerald counterparts which will be obtained and visible upon logging into the Gemini server for the very first time. A concern that occurs when merging servers is Character Name conflicts. What happens if there are two characters with the same name from the two servers? Who gets the name and who has to change their name? The rules below will help to explain the different scenarios that may occur during the merge process as well as the rules for Outfit Name conflicts. Character Name Conflict Rules Players that have logged into their character during the ninety (90) day period immediately preceding the server merge will have priority to the character name. If both players have logged into their character during the ninety (90) day period immediately preceding the server merge, priority goes to the player that created the character name first. If neither player has logged into their character during the ninety (90) day period immediately preceding the server merge, priority still goes to the player that created the character name first. Characters that are deemed to have the lower priority duplicate name based on the rules described above will have a \"-M\" (for Markov characters) or an \"-E\" (for Emerald characters) added to the end of their name. Any player that receives the \"-M\" or \"-E\" to the end of their character name will be able to change their name by using the following command in game: /rename There is no deadline for name change completion, but once a name is changed it cannot be changed again. Example of a Name Conflict: If \"Thom\" from Markov was created before \"Thom\" from Emerald, then \"Thom\" from Markov would remain the same and \"Thom\" from Emerald would become \"Thom-E\" on Gemini. Outfit Name Conflict Rules Duplicated Outfit Names will change similar to duplicated Character Names. Priority will be given to the Outfit name created first. The Outfit name created second will be deemed the duplicate name. Outfit Names that are deemed to have the duplicate Outfit Name will have a \"-M\" (for Markov Outfits) or an \"-E\" (for Emerald Outfits) added to the end of their Outfit Name. Outfits with a duplicate name containing the \"-M\" or \"-E\" suffix, will be allowed to change their Outfit Name. Outfit Leaders will be permitted to change the Outfit Name while in game with the command: /outfitrename There is no deadline for name change completion, but once a name is changed it cannot be changed again. Thank you for your patronage to the PlanetSide community. The server merge will help to keep the battlefield rich with excitement as we head into the next year of adventure. Additional FAQ When will the Markov and Emerald Servers be merged together? May 20, 2008 Which PlanetSide servers are being merged? The two North American Servers, Markov and Emerald. What is the name of the new server formed from the merge of the Markov and Emerald Servers? Gemini In the event of a character name conflict, which character will be given priority? Players that have logged into their characters during the ninety (90) day period immediately preceding the server merge will be given priority to keep their character name. However, if both characters have logged into game during the ninety (90) day period immediately preceding the server merge, then the character created first will keep the name and the character created second will be appended the applicable suffix to represent each server as follows: \"-M\" for Markov and \"-E\" for Emerald. Additionally, if neither character has logged into game during the ninety (90) day period immediately preceding the server merge, then the character created first will be given priority over the character created second and will be given the appropriate suffix: \"-M\" for Markov and \"-E\" for Emerald. Will I have a better chance to keep my character name if I have logged into my character recently? You will have a greater chance to keep your character name if the player on the other server that is about to be merged with your server has not logged into that character during the ninety (90) day period immediately preceding the server merge. Priority to keep the character name will be given to the character that was created first. The only exception to this rule is if one of the two players has not logged into that character during the ninety (90) day period immediately preceding the server merge. If I have a duplicate character name, how can I change the name? Players can use the /rename command to change their name. Naming policies still apply for this rename process. Only character names that experienced a Naming Conflict during the server merge will be able to rename their character. No other character renames will be permitted. What happens if there are two Outfits with the same name? The Outfit that created the name first will be given priority and will keep their name. The second Outfit will be given the appropriate suffix: \"-M\" for Markov and \"-E\" for Emerald. Can Outfit names be changed after the merge? Only Outfits that were appended with a \"-M\" for Markov or an \"-E\" for Emerald will be able to change their name. The Outfit leader will be permitted to use the following command to change the Outfit name: /outfitrename If you have more than eight characters on Emerald and Markov combined, you will still be able to access all characters on the new server, Gemini. Up to sixteen characters can be accessed on Gemini after the servers have been merged. After the servers have been merged, you will not be permitted to create characters if you have eight or more characters on the Gemini server. Therefore, if you have sixteen characters after the merge, you will be able to delete characters down (to 15, 14, etc...) but you will not be able to create additional characters if you have eight or more. Character Statistics on MyPlanetSide may not immediately report correct statistics after the server merge. We will work diligently to correct those issues as soon as reasonably practicable.

Taking this generator offline results in the terminals and systems of the base being taken offline, including the spawn tubes. The only exception is the Control Console , which runs on its own power supply. It also disables any Facility Linked Benefits the base may be providing. As well, the facility becomes a dead link in the Lattice system, blocking benefits from bases behind it on the lattice. Additonally, it releases the modules that may be installed in that facility. This means they can be removed or stolen from their cradles . A destroyed generator will repair itself, albeit very slowly, as long as the base has a supply of NTUs remaining. Because the generator is such an important part of facility defense, and even continental defense, a warning is issued throughout the entire Sphere of Influence ( SOI ) if it comes under attack. The generator room is also one of the areas protected by a Pain Field when a Pain Module is installed at the base, as a Lattice Benefit , or from a Cavern Lock Benefit.

When broadcasting from a warpgate to a geowarp you must first exit the warp bubble, then re-enter it and travel through the central beam to teleport to the linked cavern. Every planet possesses two Geowarps (except for the Oshur Battle Islands , which only contain one Geowarp located on Nexus , but it is presently always inactive), and two caverns are open at any time, meaning that 11 geowarps will be inactive at any given time (2 caverns x 4 geowarps per cavern - 9 planets x 2 geowarps per planet + 1 geowarp on Nexus = 11 inactive geowarps ). However, the programming intentionally makes it so that all the \" Neutral \" continents are always linked to a cave by a geowarp, even when the caves rotate.

Before The Bending occurred, all of Auraxis was still one planet. Therefore, the ten continents and three sanctuaries were all displayed on one map displaying Auraxis as one world of ten continents. However, after The Bending, Auraxis was split up into many different planets, and the Global Map was replaced by the Interstellar Map , and the Global Map became no longer accessible in game. Along with the Global Map was the Cavern Map, which showed the six Core Combat Caverns . These were displayed in a circle with the active caverns shown and the time to unlock for the other four caverns. However, with The Bending, the cavern map was removed, as the caverns were now described as asteroids and became a part of the Interstellar Map. Along with the Interstellar Map came the Battle Islands and the removal of Oshur . Advantages of the Global Map Many players are critical of the Interstellar Map, saying that the Global Map has certain advantages over the Interstellar Map. Visible Lattice With the Global Map, some users contend that the Lattice was more obvious. By clicking on a continent, a player could see which continent linked to what other continents and which warpgates are used. With the Interstellar Map, a player can only tell which continents link to each other, but must investigate the continent to find out which warpgates are used to link two continents together. Population Locks On the Global Map, Population Locks were very obvious to the user, as a population indicator for the player's Empire was placed on every continent in Auraxis that made it obvious to the player whether or not they could go to that continent due to population. However, with the Interstellar Map, a player must click on each individual planet to see how many spots are left on that particular planet. Traveling Weather With the Global Map, it was obvious to a player when weather patterns are going to move from continent to continent. However, this is completely impossible to tell with the Interstellar Map, and storms seem to be entirely random. Criticism of the Interstellar Map Many users complain about the Interstellar Map and want the Global Map back at least as an option over the Interstellar Map for the reasons stated above.

If at any point a character damages soldiers or equipment owned by their own Empire (with a weapon or a vehicle), they will be awarded grief points corresponding to the amount of damage caused. As grief points accumulate the subsequent grief added is significantly higher. This is to prevent unduly penalizing actual accidents. The Grief levels can be seen below: Grief Level Grief Points Warning/Penalty 0 0-10 None 1 11-500 Gentle Reminder/Warning 2 501-1000 Strong Warning 3 1001-5000 Grief Lock (see below) 4 5001+ 3-day Ban from Planetside If grief accumulates past 1000 points (level 3), characters will be penalized in several ways, such as being unable to fire weapons and reducing the top speed of all vehicles (so you cannot damage friendlies by running into them). The duration of the penalty is directly related to how much damage you did. The penalties will continue for each subsequent grief point earned past 1000, and will only stop when your grief points fall below 1000. You can be banned for grief points in excess of 5000. Grief points will gradually dissipate over time (1 point every 10 minutes). Note: while your grief points will dissipate even while not logged into PlanetSide, the grief lock timer does not. Thus if you have a 30 minute grief lock, you must stay logged in for it to expire, or else the lock time will carry over until your next session. Squad and outfit members are exempt from grief for damaging fellow members, as it is assumed that the squad and outfit can manage itself. You can check your Grief point total on the Character pane. Grief points are shared among characters on the same server, preventing griefers from logging in with one character, racking up grief points, and switching characters to have a clean slate. Two common sources of grief are the Thumper and the Liberator . The Thumper because in inexperienced hands it can cause a large amount of area-effect damage to friendlies (especially in confined base corridors), and the Liberator because of the delay between the release of a bomb and the subsequent detonation at ground level. category:Terminology","title":"Grief points"},{"location":"Grolley/","text":"Gr0lleY FTW!

BR6 - First slot BR12 - Second slot BR18 - Third slot Once a slot has been earned, the actual Implant in it may be changed as often as needed; unlike Certifications , there is no change-over timer.

Once enabled you may switch the implant on and off as needed. When activated, implants can quickly use up your stamina , leaving you drained and unable to run, so caution is advised. Running out of stamina will also cause all implants to turn off, although they can be immediately reactivated once stamina returns to 20 or more points.

TOC The Chat HUD The main interface of the in-game chat system. This is where all communication is sent and received. (See Also: HUD Chat Pane ) Sections The chat HUD is made up of different sections and buttons. Status Area This is the top half of the chat HUD that displays System Messages Chat Area This is the bottom half of the chat HUD that displays Chat Messages Text entry This section is at the very bottom of the chat HUD and is used for text input Options This button opens up the chat HUD options dialog box, allowing a user to define what channels they wish to see, as well as set the default channel to send messages to from the text entry area New This button opens up a second chat HUD that can be customized in the same way as the main chat HUD. Status Messages These messages are not actual user communication, but messages regarding the status of the current battle, the system and/or server, and other events of importance to the player. Killspam These messages indicate kills among players. They are formatted in the following manner: At times, the names will appear in brackets ( [name] ) to indicate that the specific player was inside a vehicle or turret at the time of the kill/death. These messages can be used to determine the current status of the battle at hand, from warning nearby players that an enemy is near to informing friendly soldiers that an enemy vehicle has been destroyed. These messages are color-coded per empire. Red Name - Terran Republic Soldier Purple Name - Vanu Sovereignty Soldier Blue Name - New Conglomerate Soldier White Name - This can occur if a player is killed by projectiles that are not \"owned\" by anyone. This can occur with slow projectiles like Flail projectiles and Orbital Strikes when the player that fired them logs off before the projectile hits. Being killed by a flail weapon directly (before it hits the ground) will also result in white killspam. Special CSR abilities like meteor showers or CSR Orbital Strikes also appear as white in the killspam. In these cases the name of the weapon / vehicle that killed the player is listed under (ie. orbital_strike_big, orbital_strike_small, Mosquito) and a white skull as . Note : If a player's squad-mate is killed, their death notice will appear to the player anywhere on the server, regardless of range to squad-mate. System Messages These messages usually indicate server, system, and/or player information and status. They are white in color by default. Typical messages include: Character has been saved Cavern closure warnings and/or notices Implant Status System errors Tactical Information These messages are the same color as System Messages, but provide tactical information pertinent to the empire. Messages include: LLU Messages Facility Capture Messages Continental Capture Messages Empire Benefit Messages (typically in Yellow ) Facility warning messages Low NTU warning Hacked facility warning Alert status Force Dome status Vehicle Warnings/Status These messages are either Red or white, depending on the message. Vehicle Stolen! will appear if an enemy Jacked your vehicle or one of your deployed One-Manned Field Turrets . The message will also display in the center of your screen. Deconstruction Warnings will be desplayed in red if your vehicle is too close to certain objects and will deconstruct if not moved within the specified number of seconds. A white message is sometimes displayed to indicate a successful exit from the deconstruction zone. Gunner/Passenger status: White messages will indicate the name of the player that has just exited or entered your vehicle. Chat Messages Chat messages are player to player communication on different channels. Chat Channels The following is a list of all the chat channels, their respective colors, and information about each. Local - White - The default channel for most clients.

Flight variants are single-pilot BFRs with a flight pack on their backs to allow the BFR to fly vertically for a short amount of time (in a similar manner to the VS MAX units' jump-jets). The flight systems are powered by the \"BFR capacitor\", which is measured with a small bar on the player's HUD . The capacitor recharges over time when the flight systems are not in use. When a flight variant uses its flight systems, the shields are deactivated for the entire time the BFR is in the air, reactivating once it lands. Additionally, the shield levels will be drained as long as the BFR is in flight. The BFR can remain airborne until the capacitor is drained, then it will begin dropping back to the ground. Flight variants have much less armor and take a larger amount of time to regenerate their shields compared to their gunner counterparts. Conversely, flight variants can run and walk much faster than the ground variants, giving them the ability to flee relatively quickly when under attack.

This guide will come in more use if you have the following Certifications\\< Reinforced Exo (Rexo - For extra inventory space, it allows you to carry more CE and decims) Engineering and Combat Engineering\\< Anti Vehicular Any vehicle cert (For an ANT)\\< HA/MA with AP ammo Not all of the above certs are a must but they will save time, at the least you must have a HA/MA weapon with AP ammo. Below are some tips on what to do before you start draining the base and how to prepare Choose Your Target Choose your target wisely, if its a base right in the centre of the map anybody will be able to look at the map and see a drain is going on. For this guide I chose Orisha on Cyssor, its at the very bottom of the map and the continent is huge, it has lots of bases and your not going to notice it that easily. When you get to the base either cap the tower nearest the base or bring an AMS with you, the AMS option is preferd but for this guide I capped the tower. (I was on my own and I don't have the cert) Another tip is to always drain a tech plant, this will give you reavers/MBT's and skyguards, this will make your assault a little easier What shall I come in? Drive to the base in an ANT, make sure it has full NTU. When you get to the base park it somewhere safe, the wall turrets will shoot you (This is where engineering will come in handy) so park it where the wall turrets wont be able to hit the ANT. For example, this is where I parked mine (The base is a Technology Plant) If you have an AMS with you, park it outside the base. Now if you have two people, one with an AMS and one with an ANT, deploy outside the base walls and place the ANT inside the bubble to cloak it from any enemys. Remember to place CE all around the AMS to kill any passers by. How does NTU draining work? The way NTU works is like this. The Base uses NTU from the NTU Silo to repair things that have been broken inside the facility. The more you destroy the more NTU the base uses up to repair the broken objects. Things inside the base to destroy include: Equipment terminals, Vehicle Terminals, Wall Turrets, spawn tubes (only destroy two, leave one up) And DAMAGE the generator don't kill it. The following pictures will give you a step by step walk through on how to drain a base. I took theese screenshots as I went along. 1\\) Before you enter the base get on Rexo and fill the layout up with Boomers, Decims/AP and an REK, don't forget the REK. (You can fit another decim in this layout) \" \" 2\\) Use mines to mine the NTU silo, this will stop enemys ants from getting in and filling up the base. \" \" 3\\) Once youve done that, start by destroying all of the turrets, it takes about four boomers to kill a turret, so start killing them. \" \" 4\\) After that start destroying all of the terminals inside the base, this includes medical terminals, equipment terminals, vehicle terminals, air terminals, the lot. \" \" \" \" \" 5\\) Next you will need to down the tubes, but not all of them. Kill only two spawn tubes. This will keep the spawn tubes down icon away from the map, if you destroy them all the icon will stay there until an enemy comes to repair them. You don't need it. REMEMBER, ONLY KILL TWO SPAWN TUBES. \" \" 6\\) Now sit back and wait, get on agile and wait for the base to turn green. Remember to keep running around the base and look for any terminals that have repaired themselves and destroy them again 7\\) As soon as the base goes neutral, it will turn a light green on the map. Expect the enemy to come now. The continent will now be \"Open\" for hart droppers and its displayed on the map. Work quickly, hack the CC and jump in your ANT and fill the silo. Get your best rexo layout on and defend the hack. :) \" If the hack gos through, you win! Congratulations, you have drained a base! EXTRA TIPS: \\- Place CE around the Silo and underpasses, includeing the roof \\- Remember spitfires are your friend, place spitfire turrets all around the base once it turns neutral \\- Use Rexo for defending the hack, most people will hot drop on the base in agile. Rexo \\> Agile \\- When damageing the generator, use about 2 Boomers and One deciminator on it, this will damage it without killing it and placeing the gen down icon on the map \\- If you have Advanced hacking, leave one equipment terminal up (If a tech plant leave the one in the lobby up) Its quicker then going back to the tower/ams for a refill on decims/ce \\- While draining a base by your lonesome may be fun, it's best done with an organized platoon. This will allow you to better defend the hack. Make sure they stay inside and stay still so as not to alert too much of a presence. -If you have an extra person with a BFR than use it to drain the silo. You can only get it to 40% though.

KAAOS (Killing As An Organized Sport) had been with PlanetSide since day one. Led by it's long-time leader Hedron, KAAOS had made it's mark by their patented \"KAAOS Drops\". This drop was marked by the large group of AirCav ( Reavers and/or Mosquitos ) that flew over a target, and dropped all at once. Once landed, and the door is breached, they surged to their target, emphasizing KAAOS' underlying principle of speed. In more recent history, KAAOS had also made its mark in the hearts of all BFR pilots. Numbers permitting, the sargeants of KAAOS would often lead the aircav fleet on Reaver runs to attack BFRs attacking a base. A leader was called, and that leader went ahead with the reaver mob behind them. The leader would then call a target BFR, and every pilot would then unload their reaver's payload into that BFR.

To report a bug, please visit the official forums or use the /bug command in game. Below is a list of currently known bugs and ways to work around them. BFR Bug Description: When gunning for a BFR you can only aim up and down, when the BFR walks you stay in one place and not with the driver. Workaround: Immediately bail out of the BFR and then go back in. Door Bug Description: Facility doors sometimes appear closed even though they are in fact open and enemy fire can go through. This bug most commonly occurs at the Back Door . Workaround: Go up to the door and open it manually. This is only a temporary fix and the bug can occur again at any time. Friendly-Manned Ancient Sentry Turret Bug Description: Sometimes a member of your own empire that is manning an Ancient Sentry Turret will have their name in enemy colors as seen with the Enhanced Targeting implant . You get grief for shooting the seemingly enemy-held turret even if the friendly is in your own platoon . Workaround: None. You can ask the occupant to get out and back in which will likely fix the problem. If you find friendlies shooting at you constantly, get out and back in yourself! Scorpion Bug Description: Sometimes the secondary bomblets fired from the Scorpion do not emerge from the primary explosion, basically making the weapon useless. Workaround: Sometimes dropping the weapon on the ground then picking it up works. Other times you have to respawn to fix the problem. Missile Lock-on Bug Description: Sometimes lock-on weapons ( Striker , Starfire , Sparrow , and Wasp ) only lock or maintain lock when the crosshair is directly over the target, making it almost impossible to maintain a lock on your target. Workaround: Usually the only way to fix the problem is to quit and open PlanetSide again. Respawning does not fix the problem in most cases. Enhanced Targeting Bug Description: The Enhanced Targeting implant will sometimes show an enemy vehicle or Wall Turret as having almost no health left, while in fact they are at full health. This sometimes happens when the vehicle is damaged, goes out of draw distance to repair, and then draws again at a later time. You will see the health it had the last time you saw the vehicle, and do not see that it was repaired. Workaround: Dealing any damage to the enemy vehicle or Turret will cause its proper health to display.

It quickly fires energy orbs which do significant damage on contact, as well as \"Lashing\" (When an orb brushes by the target) nearby enemy targets for minor damage. The orbs travel fairly quickly (as of patch 3.15.29 ) but suffer from damage degradation at longer ranges. Enemies closer than 5 meters from the shooter will not be lashed by near misses. Friendly units are immune to the lash effect at all ranges, though they will still take damage upon direct hits. The near miss lash does low damage on its own and is best used for discovering cloakers and making the enemy's COF bloom from the damage. However, it is still strong enough to make many enemies retreat if they are hiding behind a wall and is especially effective in groups of users. The secondary Armor Piercing fire mode is best used against MAXes and light vehicles . This mode lacks the lash effect and the orbs are colored purple.

This network determines which base is next available for capture by each Empire. The network can be viewed on each continent's Continental Map view. In addition, Facility Linked Benefits and module benefits are shared along unbroken chains in the lattice. Any disruption in this chain, be it a destroyed generator , enemy hack, or a base turning neutral, will break this link and sever the benefit. Lattice can also refer to the Galactic Lattice , the interstellar network tying all the planets and continents together. This can be viewed from the Interstellar Map screen. Lattice Colors and their Meaning A yellow lattice link indicates a potential capture link between friendly and enemy empires. A red, blue, or purple link indicate a connection between two friendly bases of an empire. A gray link indicates a potential capture link between two enemy empires, but not your own. A green link indicates a Sub-Capitol link, which controls the Force Dome system for Continental Capitols .

The LLU must be delivered to the specified friendly facility (indicated by the Lattice link flashing on the Continental Map screen) within 15 minutes for the hack to succeed. If the LLU contacts water, the hack is canceled. If you are the LLU runner, the destination base will have a reddish waypoint marker over it and an indicator on your radar of the destination base. It is always good strategy to give the LLU carrier (who retrieves it from the Socket or ground (if dropped) by simply touching it) a ride in a vehicle with a passenger space so as to finish the hack as soon as possible (the LLU cannot enter the following vehicles: Galaxies , Liberators , Vultures , Lodestars or BattleFrame Robotics ). Vehicles that are transporting an LLU will have speed penalties, which reduces their top speed for as long as the LLU is in it. The LLU Carrier may not pilot any vehicles themselves, nor use a Router , deconstruct themselves, or enter a Warpgate bubble. In addition, MAX Units are not able to pick up and/or carry LLU's, and Cloakers will decloak while they are carrying the LLU. The LLU carrier must deliver the LLU to the Control Console of the indicated base to capture the hacked facility. LLU bases give Battle Experience Points / Command Experience Points for being in the base during a hack (Hack and Hold amount BEP/CEP), escorting the LLU (determined by distance from it, closer you are to the LLU the more BEP/CEP you will get), and for defending the base the LLU must be taken to (least BEP/CEP). The LLU is visable on the map screen, and proximity map and the carrier will radiate yellow waves of light while carrying the LLU. You can drop the LLU (to give to another player) by pressing shift-G by default. Vehicles parked on top of an LLU in the field will be given a deconstruction warning.

The pilot has a 35mm cannon that may be suitable for attacking ground targets, and the tailgunner possesses a pivoting 25mm machine gun that is normally used to fend off aerial attacks from the rear. The gun however is positioned such that the tail of the craft restricts its vertical arc of fire considerably.

However, the bombardier may only launch bombs when the Liberator is flying level and at a safe altitude. A skilled bombardier may be capable of landing an entire magazine of ten bombs on a single point, depending on flight trajectory.

In its Primary mode, when fired it extends a \"Vortex Whip,\" a stream of energy that extends approximately 50m from the weapon and does continuous damage to its target as long as it remains in contact. The secondary mode launches a Chain-Lash grenade that explodes on contacting any soldier or vehicle, then attempts to \"Lash\" other nearby targets, much the same as the Lasher . Unlike the Lasher, the lash from a Maelstrom will hit anyone within (Approx.) 5m of the person hit, meaning it has the capability to lash all people within (approx.) 5m of anyone who has been lashed (The Lasher merely hits anyone within 5m of the orb itself, it cannot jump from person to person). It takes 5 grenades to kill a soldier wearing a Reinforced Exo-Suit . Be prepared to get plenty of Grief points if you chain-lash a bunch of friendlies! The tertiary mode is the same as the secondary, except the Chain-Lash grenade will explode after 3 seconds or upon contacting an enemy. This will allow its user to bounce Chain-Lash grenades off of walls to hit targets around corners. The Maelstrom is a powerful base defense tool as the chain lash can hurt an unlimited number of enemies in theory. The Maelstrom is also possibly the most ammo-hungry weapon in PlanetSide. It's best used in defensive roles inside a friendly SOI that has an Equipment Module installed so that the ammo recharges automatically. If used in other circumstances, one should carry plenty of ammo for it, especially if you plan on using the secondary or tertiary modes, as it takes 10 ammo \"points\" to fire one grenade.

Unique because of its non-tracked drive, the Magrider floats above the ground, enabling the vehicle to travel over water and strafe. It can be agile even when traversing rough terrain. The Magrider is the fastest of all MBTs, with a top speed of 67-68kph. [This speed is achived by driving the vehicle at an angle while strafing and moving forward.] The primary weapon of the Magrider is the heavy rail beam. Capable of direct line-of-sight fire, it is an (almost) pinpoint accurate weapon. The gun has very little splash damage, and requires multiple hits to kill a reasonably armored trooper. It is also the weakest gun of the MBTs, but the long range of the gun means that the Magrider can engage enemies before they can respond. The Magrider is also the only MBT armed with a driver weapon, the pulsed particle accelerator. The Magrider may NOT be driven while wearing the Reinforced Exo-Suit . The Magrider requires a Technology Plant lattice link or Sanctuary vehicle pad in order to be purchasable.

While the Prowler and Vanguard are better in specific situations, the Magrider is the most versatile. Your Magrider has a driver weapon, the Pulsed-Particle Accelerator (PPA). This weapon is mainly an anti-infantry weapon, but it can also turn the battle in your favor versus enemy armor. The gunner weapon is the railbeam. Unlike other tanks, this weapon has no arc and travels very fast. It has limited splash damage, and takes three hits to kill a rexo. The Magrider is also unique in that it is the only tank that can travel over water. This is a big advantage. Driver Setup driver loadout]] When you acquire your Magrider you should have a favorite with 4 boxes of PPA and 2 boxes of Rail Beam ammo. This should be your normal loadout, as the PPA goes through ammo quickly. However, if you plan on doing a lot of water driving or long range sniping, you should get 3 or 4 boxes of Rail Beam, as you won't be using the PPA much. Your favorite should also have a spare glue gun, 5 boxes of glue, and perhaps a medpack. This allows you to carry less glue in your infantry loadout, saving space for other things... Favorite for the Magrider ]] If you do a lot of tank driving, you should have a favorite with a box of PPA ammo, a glue gun, a pulsar, glue, a REK (sometimes you might need to take a tower), and whatever else you can get in there. I prefer the Pulsar to the Lasher because you can hot swap with the glue gun directly and it saves space. The Pulsar also provides medium-range fire that the lasher cannot provide if you come under attack while repairing. Have the pulsar in the rifle slot just in case you come across an enemy going to the vehicle pad. If you are CR3 or higher, take a CUD along for clearing minefields or OSing that noob stationary BFR you come across. The implants I recommend are Enhanced Targeting , Darklight , and Audio Amplifier . Always have Audio Amp on, and Darklight lets you run over those pesky cloakers. Driver Tactics Before I go any further, let me say that if your gunner is not on voice comms with you, you're only operating at 50% efficiency. A good driver is worthless if your gunner can't help you out. Your gunner needs to be able to convey threats to you and give you more situational awareness. Your goal while driving is to keep the tank alive. Certain situations dictate that you might need to sacrifice yourself to kill your target, but you need to have the discipline to know when to disengage to avoid death, even though your target just needs 1 or 2 more hits to kill. Getting kills comes naturally, but only if you can keep the tank alive. Disengaging and quickly repairing will yield more kills over time than killing that one tank while getting killed yourself, then pulling a new tank. Your secondary goal is to get kills, or more specifically drive such that your gunner can get kills. The main advantage of the magrider is its long range weapon. You want to keep as much distance between you and your target as possible. Your gunner should let you know if the target is out of range. Find a target. Stay at maximum range and stationary to engage if not under fire. If you are on water, you can move as much as you like, as long as you stay in range. Roads: Avoid roads if at all possible. Always assume the roads are filled with mines. If you must drive on the road, drive as far to the side as possible. Water: Water is your friend. Drive on water whenever possible. If you hug the shoreline, your speed will not decrease. The main benefit of water is that it provides a stable surface for your gunner. Driving in long circles out in the middle of the water allows your gunner to hit almost anything with pinpoint accuracy, while dodging almost all enemy fire. I've literally done this for 5 minutes with multiple enemies trying to kill us. Hills: Avoid when you can, as it is very hard for the gunner to hit anything. However, sometimes getting on top of a hill overlooking a base can yield many kills. If you strafe while going up a hill, you get more torque out of the tank, so keep that in mind. Trees: Trees are the friend of an experienced Magrider driver, but can be deadly for the inexperienced. Your tank is not as wide as the other tanks, and you can slip through the trees and run away easily. Inexperienced drivers will get stuck in the trees, leading to death many times. You should be glancing at your mini-map (radar) every second or 2. You need to watch out for Liberators lining you up all the time. Fixating on a target for 5 seconds is enough time for bombs to come out of nowhere and kill you. Pay attention at all times. The minimap also lets you see potential targets. The Mosquito 's overflight radar data is transmitted to you as well, letting you see targets you might not otherwise. Motion detectors also give you information, but you will miss it if you don't constantly look at your radar. It also lets you see how the tank your gunner is engaging moves, allowing you to determine which way you need to turn to follow or run. Remember you have a weapon too. Many times you will get killed if you don't use it, but other times you might get too fixated on a target and not pay attention to driving and keeping you alive (your main goal). Lone infantry are perfect prey for the PPA. Hit them a few times with the PPA, then run over them. Always be aware for traps, however. Trying to run over infantry sometimes leads you straight into a minefield. If you find a minefield, stop as soon as possible. Reverse course, and go as you came. Repair whenever possible. If you are less than half health, you need to repair immediately unless you are in a 1 vs 1 battle and you think you can finish them. Even if you are only slightly damaged, repair if you are not under fire, as that extra health might save you in just a few seconds. Usually you want to go away from the battle to repair, but if you're on a good hill or at long range, you can turn your tank to block fire, and repair yourself in battle. While you are out, your gunner is actually more accurate, as the tank will not be bouncing up and down as normal. When repairing, your gunner should do a quick darklight sweep to look for cloakers. If it's clear and you don't expect enemies, the gunner should help you repair. You should almost require your gunner have a glue gun, or else you will spend a lot of time repairing yourself, which is a waste of time. If you have Amp Station benefit, try to repair inside a friendly SOI to build shields while you repair. If you have Dropship Center benefit, get ammo and let your gunner repair you at the repair silo if it's clear. If you drive conservatively, you can live for hours with the same tank, and get 100+ assists easily. Too many tank drivers I gun for drive straight into the battle, and never repair. Target-Specific Tactics Aircraft: Reavers are the main threat here, but all aircraft are treated the same. You have two choices: try to kill it, or drag him by friendlies. If you chose to kill it, find water and drive in circles. You gunner should hopefully be able to kill him easily. If you can't find water, find a relatively flat spot of ground, and strafe slowly in one direction. This lets your gunner have a stable platform and you might dodge a few missiles. If there are no flat spots around, if you are badly damaged, or if the aircraft is smart and flies almost directly overhead, head for the trees and friendlies. Lightnings : Not much of a threat. Usually you can just snipe them at long range, or head straight in for the kill. If there are lots of them, keep moving to avoid fire. Use the PPA for even quicker kills. Fury : One of your biggest threats. Second only to the reaver, you should kill these first. The rockets from the Fury do massive damage. Lure them to open ground where you can kill them easily. Flight Variant BFRs : These BFRs have the same top speed as a Mag while in run mode. Get out on water and run in circles. Disengage if you get badly hurt. You can win 1 on 1 with a flight variant if you drive well, but engage cautiously. If anything else starts shooting at you, break away. Sunderer Variants ( Vindicator , Juggernaut , and Leviathan ): Though all very similar in firepower, the Vindicator has a slight edge because of the high damage of the 20mm and the projectile veolocity, but you can treat all variants the same. The biggest threat these vehicles pose is their EMP blast. Stay as far away as possible to engage, so you stay out of the blast range. Zig-zag to avoid the 75mm fire, as this is the majority of their firepower. The profile is so big that it's hard to miss them at any range, so don't be shy about staying far away. If you come on one them by surprise another tactic you can use is to stay as close as possible to them. You will stay below their gun arc (unless they have a ballgunner , but it doesn't do much damage) and will be relatively safe. However, you are prone to EMP blasts and the splash from your own railbeam weapon, so only use this tactic if you are isolated from heavy fighting or know that they already used their EMP. One-Manned Field Turrets : All OMFTs are similar and suffer from damage degredation. Get too close and you will be shredded up. The range of the turrets is 250m, so you have 50m more range to use to your advantage. Avoid close encounters unless you are at full health, and finish them off if you get the chance, as their shields recharge and you don't want to waste your efforts. New Conglomerate Vanguard : Probably the easiest enemy tank to kill. While they have the most armor, and heaviest hitting gun, they lack mobility and rate of fire. However, if you engage at close range, you will likely die. Engage at medium-long range and move to avoid fire. If you must engage at close range, use the PPA and weave through trees. If you can't get the first 3 or 4 rail beam shots on him before he notices you, you probably need to disengage. If one is following you, head for water, or trees. Vanguards have a really tough time in trees. When they get stuck in the trees, circle back and finish them off. Thunderer : I fear this vehicle the most of any enemy vehicle. It has direct fire weapons, meaning that most of your normal tactics don't work. Running for water might not be the best choice when facing thunderers because if they follow you into the water, only half of their surface area is hittable, while you are no different. Keep as far away from thunderers as possible, where you still can dodge their slow projectiles. If you find dueling one at close range, you MUST engage with the PPA. It is the ONLY way you will win, as the Thunderer with two gunners has a faster time to kill on a Magrider, than the Rail Beam alone can match. Enforcer : Usually not much of a threat, unless they are in packs. They are fast, however, which makes killing them a little tricky. Phoenix : While the Phoenix has a slow rate of fire, when it does hit, it hurts. Avoid hills where Phoenix users can hide. If there is just one, close and kill. Watch your minimap for the direction. The main limitation is its range. When running from Phoenixes, run in a straight line away from the user. Hopefully the fuse will burn out before it gets to you. Sometimes weaving in trees can scrape off inexperienced Phoenix users. Peregrine : If it has the particle cannon as the gunner weapon (which almost all of them do), avoid at all costs. The particle cannon can kill you very quickly and is very accurate. Don't fire upon it to let them know you are there, and only fire on it if it's hurting or others are helping you. The shield regeneration rate of a crouched BFR is only slightly less than the damage the rail beam can deliver. You will be shooting at it a very long time if you think you will kill it alone. Terran Republic Prowler : This is your biggest enemy tank threat. At close range, the Prowler will kill you in the blink of an eye, especially with 2 gunners. Use the same tactics as the Vanguard above. Stay as far away as possible and lure them into trees or head for water. Raider : While not as deadly as the Thunderer , at point blank range, you will still have a hard time winning. Keep as far away as possible, where the damage of the raider is less. Like the tactics for the Thunderer , water might not always be the right choice. Marauder : Very little threat unless you are heavily damaged. Pursue and destroy, but watch for their heavy hitting brothers. This vehicle can carry 3 striker-equipped troops. They pose a bigger threat when the bail and Striker you. Kill them before they can bail. Striker : A lone striker is no threat, but it seems like just about every TR player has one. If you get locked on, head for obstacles to break the lock. Even if you do break the lock, you need to change direction, since the rocket can sill hit you if you don't. Colossus : Not as bad as the Peregrine , but still just as hard to kill. Treat like a Prowler to avoid fire. Vanu Sovereignty Magrider : Rarely encountered, but a big threat. Head for trees, where you will likely make the less experienced magrider driver get hung up. Aurora : Laugh at them after you kill them. Not a big threat. Thresher : Keep moving to avoid fire. Treat like an Enforcer . Lancer : Not much you can do to avoid fire. Find cover and try to get out of range, though the range is huge. Trees might help. Aphelion : If you ever find one of these, it's rare. They have decent anti-vehicular armorment, so it's best to stay away. It's harder to dodge hits, since the fire is direct fire. Gunner Guide gunner loadout. Replace the CUD with two more boxes of glue if not CR3 or above. More glue should always be in the trunk.]] As stated before, ideally you need to be on voice comms with your driver. You don't have time to type \"I see a vanguard on the other hill, steady me for a second\". If you know you will be gunning, your loadout should carry two boxes of rail beam ammo and one box of PPA. You should have a glue gun, and a Lasher if you have it certed, though a Pulsar is fine too. You don't need to carry more than 1 or two boxes of repair juice, since hopefully your driver has plenty in the trunk if you run out. Recommended implants are Enhanced Targeting and Darklight . The third slot is up to you, but Audio Amplifier is probably best. Like driving, the gunner needs to be looking at the radar screen every few seconds. It might alert you of that cloaker that is right next to you or a liberator lining you up. If you see puffs of green smoke ahead, that's likely an enemy cloaker laying mines down. Anticipate where he is and shoot him. Don't fixate too much on any given target. While you're firing at that Prowler a mile away, your driver might have just run into a Thunderer at point blank range and needs your help pronto. Your main goal while gunning is to defend the tank. Your secondary goal is to attack targets. Thus if you are chasing a Vanguard but a Reaver is killing you, you need to direct fire at the Reaver first. You should always target the least armored and most heavily armed targets first. A rough order of threats that you should engage when on the defense: Reaver : Probably your biggest threat, so they should always be priority if you know they see you. Fury : Very damaging weapon, but relatively easy to kill. Kill first. AV MAX units: Falcon is not much a threat, but if a Pounder if firing at you, it should be second only to the reaver, as they can kill you very quickly. Nearby Anti-Vehicular Troops: If you have a good line of sight on them, target them before enemy tanks. But if they are hiding behind trees or cover, ignore. Tanks: Low on the list, but they have high firepower if they are nearby. Thunderer and Raider : Low armor, but high damage output. As stated earlier, we want to avoid contact at close range, but if you do, these should be second only to the reaver. Assault Buggies: Not much of a threat, so these should be a very low priority when under fire. Sunderer Variants: Moderate threat, but takes a long time to take down. Engage if it's the only threat, but ignore if there are deadlier enemies out there. Mosquito Usually not much of a threat, but likely a quick take-down. BFRs : Lowest of all, since you almost ask for death if you start shooting them. If they are hurt or others are engaging with you, take them out. On the attack, you should be targeting AMSes , tanks, and MAX units in that order as priority, though it's never bad to work in a quick infantry kill when possible. When your driver stops to repair, do a quick darklight sweep of the area to check for cloakers, especially near Lodestars . After that, you need to make a judgment to either help repair, or stay in the gun. Only experience will help you make the decision. The most important job of the gunner is to communicate the surroundings to the driver, which is best done through voice comms. If you are pursuing a target, the driver usually knows the situation quite well, though if something starts attacking you from behind, you need to start talking to the driver. If something is following you, YOU need to become the commander of the tank. If the target following you is hurting badly, and you're a little better off, but the target stops following you, you need to make a decision. One choice would be to tell the driver to turn around and finish him off, though if you think it's too big a risk, tell him to keep running. The driver can't see behind you, so you need to tell him what's happening. When on the attack, you need to talk as well. You should be saying things like \"steady me for a second\", \"no shot, move left a little\", \"target is out of range\", \"target is down, we're clear\", or \"get us out of here\". Without the driver having this information, you're only running at 50% efficiency. A good driver and gunner can easily play for 3 hours and have a 50 to 1 kill to death ratio. You will get killed, there is no avoiding it, but by following this guide, you will have already made your mark...for quite a long time hopefully. New CE Addendum With the addition of the new Combat Engineering , several new tactics can be introduced. The main change for tank drivers is the use of the Aegis Shield Generator . By having an FDU either in you or your gunner's inventory, or in your mag's trunk , you can make a cloaked repair station. When you get out to repair, place an Aegis down beside you. This will cloak you while you repair. If you plan on coming back to the same spot for a while, you might consider charging the shield up to provide even more cover. Note, however, that charging the shield takes a signigicant amount of \"glue\", time, and the FDU takes up a lot of room to store. Thus, be sure you still have enough glue to repair the mag itself, as you cannot get more from the Aegis. Usually it's not worth the time to charge the shield, but the cloaking effect is well worth it. Cerberus Turrets are also a nice addition for tank drivers. Place 1 or 2 of these at your repair site to scare away enemy air cav. You can also set up many more in a single area and use it as a retreating point to scare off that Reaver that is chasing you. The new Anti-Vehicular Wall Turret can make quick work of a mag. The damage per second is roughly equivalent to the Prowler ! These upgraded turrets should be taken out whenever possible. Treat like a Colossus : stay far away and strafe to avoid fire and engage with the long range of the rail beam. TRAPs are usually not a great concern to a Magrider. You usually see them on bridges, but Mags can easily avoid bridges. Be aware that you can drive stright through a friendly TRAP as if it were not there. category: Strategy","title":"Magrider Guide by Quovatis"},{"location":"Magrider_Guide_by_Quovatis/#magrider-properties","text":"I consider the Magrider to be the best tank in planetside. While the Prowler and Vanguard are better in specific situations, the Magrider is the most versatile. Your Magrider has a driver weapon, the Pulsed-Particle Accelerator (PPA). This weapon is mainly an anti-infantry weapon, but it can also turn the battle in your favor versus enemy armor. The gunner weapon is the railbeam. Unlike other tanks, this weapon has no arc and travels very fast. It has limited splash damage, and takes three hits to kill a rexo. The Magrider is also unique in that it is the only tank that can travel over water. This is a big advantage.","title":"Magrider Properties"},{"location":"Magrider_Guide_by_Quovatis/#driver-setup","text":"driver loadout]] When you acquire your Magrider you should have a favorite with 4 boxes of PPA and 2 boxes of Rail Beam ammo. This should be your normal loadout, as the PPA goes through ammo quickly. However, if you plan on doing a lot of water driving or long range sniping, you should get 3 or 4 boxes of Rail Beam, as you won't be using the PPA much. Your favorite should also have a spare glue gun, 5 boxes of glue, and perhaps a medpack. This allows you to carry less glue in your infantry loadout, saving space for other things... Favorite for the Magrider ]] If you do a lot of tank driving, you should have a favorite with a box of PPA ammo, a glue gun, a pulsar, glue, a REK (sometimes you might need to take a tower), and whatever else you can get in there. I prefer the Pulsar to the Lasher because you can hot swap with the glue gun directly and it saves space. The Pulsar also provides medium-range fire that the lasher cannot provide if you come under attack while repairing. Have the pulsar in the rifle slot just in case you come across an enemy going to the vehicle pad. If you are CR3 or higher, take a CUD along for clearing minefields or OSing that noob stationary BFR you come across. The implants I recommend are Enhanced Targeting , Darklight , and Audio Amplifier . Always have Audio Amp on, and Darklight lets you run over those pesky cloakers.","title":"Driver Setup"},{"location":"Magrider_Guide_by_Quovatis/#driver-tactics","text":"Before I go any further, let me say that if your gunner is not on voice comms with you, you're only operating at 50% efficiency. A good driver is worthless if your gunner can't help you out. Your gunner needs to be able to convey threats to you and give you more situational awareness. Your goal while driving is to keep the tank alive. Certain situations dictate that you might need to sacrifice yourself to kill your target, but you need to have the discipline to know when to disengage to avoid death, even though your target just needs 1 or 2 more hits to kill. Getting kills comes naturally, but only if you can keep the tank alive. Disengaging and quickly repairing will yield more kills over time than killing that one tank while getting killed yourself, then pulling a new tank. Your secondary goal is to get kills, or more specifically drive such that your gunner can get kills. The main advantage of the magrider is its long range weapon. You want to keep as much distance between you and your target as possible. Your gunner should let you know if the target is out of range. Find a target. Stay at maximum range and stationary to engage if not under fire. If you are on water, you can move as much as you like, as long as you stay in range. Roads: Avoid roads if at all possible. Always assume the roads are filled with mines. If you must drive on the road, drive as far to the side as possible. Water: Water is your friend. Drive on water whenever possible. If you hug the shoreline, your speed will not decrease. The main benefit of water is that it provides a stable surface for your gunner. Driving in long circles out in the middle of the water allows your gunner to hit almost anything with pinpoint accuracy, while dodging almost all enemy fire. I've literally done this for 5 minutes with multiple enemies trying to kill us. Hills: Avoid when you can, as it is very hard for the gunner to hit anything. However, sometimes getting on top of a hill overlooking a base can yield many kills. If you strafe while going up a hill, you get more torque out of the tank, so keep that in mind. Trees: Trees are the friend of an experienced Magrider driver, but can be deadly for the inexperienced. Your tank is not as wide as the other tanks, and you can slip through the trees and run away easily. Inexperienced drivers will get stuck in the trees, leading to death many times. You should be glancing at your mini-map (radar) every second or 2. You need to watch out for Liberators lining you up all the time. Fixating on a target for 5 seconds is enough time for bombs to come out of nowhere and kill you. Pay attention at all times. The minimap also lets you see potential targets. The Mosquito 's overflight radar data is transmitted to you as well, letting you see targets you might not otherwise. Motion detectors also give you information, but you will miss it if you don't constantly look at your radar.

You will get killed, there is no avoiding it, but by following this guide, you will have already made your mark...for quite a long time hopefully.","title":"Gunner Guide"},{"location":"Magrider_Guide_by_Quovatis/#new-ce-addendum","text":"With the addition of the new Combat Engineering , several new tactics can be introduced. The main change for tank drivers is the use of the Aegis Shield Generator . By having an FDU either in you or your gunner's inventory, or in your mag's trunk , you can make a cloaked repair station. When you get out to repair, place an Aegis down beside you. This will cloak you while you repair. If you plan on coming back to the same spot for a while, you might consider charging the shield up to provide even more cover. Note, however, that charging the shield takes a signigicant amount of \"glue\", time, and the FDU takes up a lot of room to store. Thus, be sure you still have enough glue to repair the mag itself, as you cannot get more from the Aegis. Usually it's not worth the time to charge the shield, but the cloaking effect is well worth it. Cerberus Turrets are also a nice addition for tank drivers. Place 1 or 2 of these at your repair site to scare away enemy air cav. You can also set up many more in a single area and use it as a retreating point to scare off that Reaver that is chasing you. The new Anti-Vehicular Wall Turret can make quick work of a mag. The damage per second is roughly equivalent to the Prowler ! These upgraded turrets should be taken out whenever possible. Treat like a Colossus : stay far away and strafe to avoid fire and engage with the long range of the rail beam. TRAPs are usually not a great concern to a Magrider. You usually see them on bridges, but Mags can easily avoid bridges. Be aware that you can drive stright through a friendly TRAP as if it were not there. category: Strategy","title":"New CE Addendum"},{"location":"Main_Page/","text":"MediaWiki has been successfully installed.

If you have a top-of-the-line system, then you might be able to squeeze by, but in that case, what are you reading this for? Screen Resolution : Higher resolution means more pixels on the screen, and that means your graphics card has to draw more pixels every frame, which slows it down. If you want better framerates, decrease this, though there's no reason to go below 1024x768, and if you do, the HUD will be cramping your display to the extreme. Gamma Brightness and Gamma Contrast : These are monitor hardware settings and have nothing to do with framerates. Usually you won't ever touch them, but if the screen looks too dark or washed-out while you're playing, try sliding these around. Note that if Planetside CTDs while you're playing with an other-than-normal gamma setting, your desktop will keep that setting, and you'll probably have to restart your computer or dig into your graphics card settings to get rid of it. Not fun. Video Quality : Just a way to select from some pre-set video options. You can completely ignore this, it's better to do all the tweaking yourself to get a nice balance between good looks and good framerates. Viewing Distance : Affects how far you can see. As you decrease this, you'll see the view-distance \"fog\" rolling in to decrease your vision range. Less things that you can see means less things the graphics card has to draw, and better framerates. Don't worry, though; if you have everything else set way down low, you can crank this up to maximum with hardly any impact on your FPS. Besides, you don't want other people to be able to see farther than you can, do you? Video Bit-Depth : Affects how many colors are available to Planetside for drawing, well, everything. If you decrease this to 16-bit, your FPS will nearly double, but be warned, it makes the game look like total crap and nearly always causes catastrophic shearing. Do this only if you've tried everything else and your framerates are still unbearable, and I do mean unbearable. Texture Quality : Affects how blurry objects in the game look. The lower you go, the less sharply-defined they get, but the higher your framerates go. Increasing this setting by one step is roughly equivalent to doubling the amount of RAM Planetside needs to keep running, so use with caution. Setting this to \"Low\" can be a big framerate booster, and unlike changing to 16-bit color, things don't look too bad unless you get up close and personal. If High just isn't good enough for you, and you're running the Cray supercomputer, you can take this to the next level of detail under Advanced. Particle Effects : Particles come in all sorts of guises, but one mark of their appearance is that they usually don't last for very long. You can find particles in puffs of vehicle exhaust, explosions of any kind, orbital strikes, and more. This option sets the detail level of the particles and affects how cool things that involve particles look, as well as how many of them are created. If you set this to Low, you might not even see some particle effects at all. It doesn't make that much of a difference, but it can indeed impact your framerate if there's a ton of battle activity in the area. Addition by Raidin - Another thing worth mentioning is that when you raise this to High, it turns on dynamic lighting for muzzle flashes on most, if not all weapons. Dynamic lighting does take its toll on FPS, and can slow you down to a crawl on an average video card if you have several people firing their weapons on-screen at once. Try all 3 settings with some friends to find your favorite. Flora Density : Affects how much planty stuff appears on the ground around you, thus enhancing the realism. Thank goodness this can be turned off, because even on Low, it sucks FPS like mad. The reason is that it uses a ton of alpha transparency, which takes your video card a while to compute and slows it down. Turn it Off for best performance. Mesh Detail (by Raidin) : This increases the polygon count on player and weapon models. They look better up-close but your video card has to render those extra polys. From my experience, the FPS decrease is negligible. The increase in graphic quality, however, is worth it, IMO. Experiment for yourselves. Addition by Sokko: I must admit he's right. Since it hardly ever impacts your framerate, the increase in detail when you're looking at something close to you is well worth it. Without this turned on, weapons especially look far too blocky for you to even recognize. Turn it on unless you're working with a 386. Draw Detail Web : Turning this on will make a large area of the terrain around you (the part you're usually concerned about) appear more detailed, though far-off terrain remains the same. Though it certainly looks pretty, it really does a number on your framerate, dropping it by 20 or more in some cases. Best to leave it off. Warpgate Effect : The weird little effect that shows when an object moves through (or stops at, in the case of shots) a warpgate bubble. So far as I can tell, it doesn't make a significant difference where framerate is concerned. Oddly enough, you must have Bullet Holes turned on in order for this to work. Bullet Holes : If you turn this on, bullet-based weapons will leave holes in the walls. Drawing all those extra decals does impact framerate, but not as much as you'd think. Like the above, it's a matter of whether you want those few extra FPS or not, and remember that you have to turn this on for the Warpgate Effect to show up. Note: When a large weapon impacts One-Manned Field Turrets , it leaves a black \"burn\" mark. Over time, these build up into a black sheet, which can block the vision of the gunner in certain directions. If you gun field turrets often, it's best to keep this option off. Shadows On/Off : If turned on, people and vehicles will cast shadows on the ground. It's a bit more of a significant impact on framerate than the Bullet Holes, and it's not really that much of a visual difference. Off is recommended. Weather Particles : Different from regular particles, weather particles are what appear when a weather front moves into town, like that ever actually happens (c'mon, devs, you can do better than that!). Thunderstorms, snowstorms, dust storms, all are composed of weather particles. None of these have a really significant impact on framerate at all. Leaving it off does not create a tactical advantage, since even if you can't see the weather particles, it's the view distance fog moving in that matters. Note by Marutuk: Apparently you now need to have the Skydome turned on for this option to work. Skydome : This draws a whole bunch of eye candy up in the sky, which affects your framerate so randomly it's best to experiment with it for yourself. As stated above, you must have this turned on for Weather Particles to appear. Advanced Options Texture Quality (32 bit) : Click this on, and get ready for a whole world of hurt in the graphics card department. Checking it is like selecting \"Super High\" in the Texture Quality on the previous tab. If you do, you can select which textures this should apply to by checking the big group of boxes in the lower half of this tab. Trust me, never check this box unless you've got the Batcomputer sitting on your desktop. Vertical Sync : Simply put, it makes the game easier on the eyes. If the graphics seem \"flickery\" to you or your eyes start to ache after a while playing, turn this on, but be warned that it does negatively impact your framerate. Also, sometimes your graphics card will already have VSync turned on by itself, so checking this will make no difference. Use triple buffer : Does what it says on the tooltip: It makes the game run smoother, but it uses a bit more RAM to do so. Checking this box will speed up your framerate and eliminate lots of freezing if you have enough RAM, but can negatively affect it if you don't. Fiddle around with it to find the best setting, and don't forget to try out a full-fledged battle or two while you're testing. Cull Animations : If this box is checked, the game will make player animations more jerky if your framerate is starting to suffer from a lot of activity in the area, thus making things easier on your graphics card. A lot of people just can't stand those jerky animations, so they turn this off. It does make a difference, but the actual amount of difference varies wildly. Select the mode for preloading textures : Shouldn't be touched under normal circumstances. As the text says, \"All\" will let Planetside take care of things for you, and is generally the best way to do things performance-wise. If you're really desperate, you can try setting this to other things, but don't expect a miracle. Reserved Texture : Defines a chunk of RAM that's used to store textures for quick copying to the VRAM on your graphics card, so they don't have to be loaded from the hard disk. Making it larger will get you smoother framerates (especially if you've increased the Texture Quality), but it might also slow things down because the game has less RAM to store other things in. Leaving it at the lowest setting is not recommended unless you have 512MB or less of RAM, so experiment to find out the highest it can safely go without impacting performance. Note that this should be the LAST bit of experimenting you do, after you finish setting all the other options. One perk of this option is that you don't have to restart PS for it to take effect; loading another continent and just playing for a bit is sufficient for it to fully kick in. Use detailed vehicles : Turning this off will make vehicles slightly less detailed and give them a different paint job. This doesn't make much of a difference FPS-wise unless there are a lot of vehicles in the area, and it has been known to cause graphical glitches (like detached thruster pods), so you should probably leave it on unless you REALLY like the alternate color scheme (ugh).

Merit Commendation Streaks Some Merit Commendations require X amount of kills to qualify for that merit, and then a streak to complete it. Said streaks require you to kill a certain amount of people without dying. Example: The Heavy Assault Platinum Merit Commendation requires 8,000 kills to Qualify for it. After you have achieved those 8,000 kills the game will flag you as Qualified and you will have to kill 12 Enemy Soldiers ( Unique Kills ) to obtain the Heavy Assault Platinum Merit. You don't have to complete the streak in the same session, however, you can work on it until you complete it. Streak kills are also saved if you logout, meaning that if you have 8 kills for the Heavy Assault Platinum streak, and you logout, you will still have those 8 kills when you start PlanetSide next time (provided you don't log on a different character on that server or there is a game update/crash between your sessions). If you are working on a streak for a Merit, which requires 5 kills and you die after getting 4 Streak kills, those 4 kills will count towards the next level of the Merit that you are working on. Example: You are working on Basic Weapons Silver streak, which requires 4 kills and it takes you 50 kills until you finally get 4 in one life, then you will only have to get 50 kills to qualify for Basic Weapons Gold, instead of 100.

They are large rocks that hit the ground and do a large amount of damage to anything nearby. Only very heavily armored vehicles such as BFRs and Galaxy Gunships can survive a direct hit.

Single meteors can also be called and directed at players the GM dislikes at the time. The most common use for meteors is to add atmosphere to a special event or to generally annoy the players in a large battle.

It follows the principle of all the Terran Republic weapons, sacrificing damage per hit for rapid fire. Like all Heavy Assault weaponry, the Mini-Chaingun meets its highest damage output at close quarters, when all or most of its bullets have opportunity to hit their target. However, the Mini-Chaingun can be used to some effectiveness at medium ranges if the weapon is carefully burst-fired. This allows the Mini-Chaingun to gain a slight advantage over enemy soldiers toting empire-specific Heavy Assault weaponry outdoors.

THIS IS NOT FOR UB3R GR34T VETERANS this is for those in planetside who have been around for a bit and want to learn more. I am TR by the way in case you think i am being biast (and PM me if you think i am :D ). Your Weapons Heavy assault MCG (minichaingun): The TR empire specific HA weapon is the MCG. It packs a hefty punch and spews bullets at an alarming rate. It's range is superior to both the lasher and jackhammer making it a better choice in an outdoor situation(it is most effective at 25-30 metre range) although it does suffer at range against medium assault weapons. It has a very large clip (100) but can sill run out of bullets quickly. The major problems with the MCG are its weakness at close range and it's massive CoF (cone of fire) bloom after taking the slightest bit of damage or afterit shoots 13 shots at full auto. It is good on defence as it is able to lay down a wall of fire no non MAX unit will want to get through. It is best combined with rexo armour as you do not need agility (unlike the JH) and the extra armour can save your life. JH (Jackhammer): The Jackhammer is the NC HA weapon. It is a triple barrelled combat shotgun which can make mincemeat of the enemy IF you get close enough (10- metres is optimum range). It can kill in about 3 shots against non-MAX armour and doesn't require too much aiming. The main problem is having to get within that optimum range and the fact that unlike the TR and VS the NC can't lay down a wall of fire with their weapon and have to rely on other tactics. Problems include it's slow reload time, it's sometimes rubbish secondary fire and the massive penalty for missing. The JH is best used combined with agile armour in order to get close enough to the enemy before you are turned into small chunks of meat (or in the case of the VS a barbeque rib). The jackhammer isn't very good outdoors but if you can get in close....It's deadly. The lasher: Some may call it a spam weapon but it does require some skill to learn how to use it effectively. It has a decent rate of fire and like the minichaingun it can hold down a backdoor for ages. It's lasher orbs only do a bit of damage (around 10 hp) but it can be worth it as it not only hurts multiple enemies but messes up their CoF. It's optimum range is around 15 metres so it is excellent in indoor fights. It's inaccuracy makes it weak outdoors compared to MA weapons or the MCG but this depends on your skill. It's major problem is it's slow moving projectiles meaning that an enemy can hit you before you have the chance of hitting them. The maelstrom (AT): This is an ancient tech (AT) weapon meaning it can only be used IF you both own the core combat expansion and have access to a cave terminal, cave lock and/or equipment module. It is extremly powerful in each of it's modes. It's first mode is the Vortex Whip. This is like a stream of electricity which damages an enemy for as long as you keep the crosshairs on him. The second and third modes fire out a grenade that works simarily to the Thumper. The grenade explodes causing splash damage to those nearby and does incredible damage. Further, the grenade splash damage can jump from person to person as long as each successive link in the chain is at 5m or less from the previous person. The maelstrom benefits from certain mods which recharge it's ammo making it able to hold backdoors by consatntly spamming the area. Medium Assault: Punisher: Known to many as the \"Swiss army knife\" of PS weaponry, the Punisher is versatile but lacks focus. It's grenade launcher is extremely slow to reload leaving you vulnerable after you fire your shots. A common mistake for new players is that the punisher's rocket is good at AV. It isn't. The damage amount is small and the slow reload time leaves you easy prey for any nearby enemies. In most cases it is easier just to throw a grenade than use the grenade launcher and without it the punisher is a sub-par infantry weapon. It is probably best to avoid unless you are experienced with it. Sweeper: The sweeper is a useful weapon indoors if you can learn to use it properly. It has enough power to take out most infantry in 4 shots if you can make them all land. This weapon has limited application outside as it is a shotgun but inside it can be deadly if you can get within range. With a decent clip, good punch and fair refire rate, the sweeper is a sound weapon. Cycler: The Terran Republic's Medium Assault is a well rounded weapon. Compared to the other empire specific Medium Assault weapons, they have a bigger clip (50 compared to 30) and faster fire rate. It is accurate in short bursts but blooms when fired for too long. Gauss rifle: This is the New Comglomerate's empire specific weapon and in line with their empire's way of thinking it deals the most damage per shot and so can take out a rexo in only 10 shots. It has a small clip (30), a slower refire rate and slightly less accuracy than the cycler. Pulsar: My personal favourite, the pulsar has very good accuracy, high damage and an ability to switch the weapon to fire AP rounds without having to reload. It has a medium clip (40 rounds) and makes a cool noise (obviously a plus). I Try to loot as many of these as possible as i seem to get good kill streaks with them. Special assault Thumper: This is a very versatile and powerful weapon in the hands of an experienced player but can be difficult for the new player to use. It can fire 3 different types of round: Fragmentation grenades: Ideal for the newer player as they have a smaller blast radius so it is easier to use without griefing others. It also has some (but not much) damage against MAXes. Plasma grenades: Extremely powerful but unpredictable, these weapons can do serious damage to enemies but also can be \"grief machines\" if used uncorrectly. Can kill cloakers in a single hit. Jammer grenades: Like normal Jammers these can disable enemy CE, detonate boomers from a safe range, deactivate implants and destroy vehicular weapon systems. The extra range of the thumper means it is easier to disable spitfires, vehicles and implants from a safe range. Extremely handy! Rocklet rifle: This weapon can fire in two modes: a normal single shot mode or a rapid fire mode that fires all the shots in the magazine at once with a slight decrease to accuracy. It has two ammo types: Rocket pod: A single magazine of rocket pods can take out a rexo trooper if all the shots hit and can annihilate MAXes in two magazines. It can also do decent damage to light vehicles and aircraft. Fragmentation ammo: Using the same ammo type as a thumper this mode can do decent damage to light vehicles and can take out aircraft with far more ease than the rockets due to it's splash damage.

Category:Strategy","title":"Special assault"},{"location":"Minignus_infiltrator_startup/","text":"Right this is for the REALLY new people ;) First up remember that if you want LOADS of kills this not be the setup for you. If you are new it's probably best to start with heavy assault and the like. CERTS There are many certs that are useful with infiltrator: Combat engineering: Probably the best cert you can have as an infiltrator. Boomers can be used to take out unwary snipers, turrets and unwary troops with ease. By deploying a boomer at the back door of a facility you can get the odd kill very easily. Boomers are also useful for taking down generators, spawn tubes or terminals meaning a single infiltrator can really slow down enemy proggress. Spitfires are handy in the field or on defence. They are likely to draw enemy fire from you but it may mean the enemy can realise you are nearby so strategic placing is encouraged. Mines are great for infiltrators as they are seriously dangerous against vehicles and MAXes. Even if the enemy sees you you may be able to get a kill depending on your reactions. If a MAX sees you simply jump behind him and lay a mine to take off about 1/2 health and armour. Boomer damage table hijacked from iluvthequasar's thread : *1 boomer: ANY terminal, ATV, infantry, Spitfire turret *2 boomers: Lightning, MAX, any Buggy, Reaver, Mosquito, Unmanned FV, Spawn tube *3 boomers: Deliverer and Variants, ANT, Liberator *4 boomers: Wall turret, MBT, Sunderer, AMS, Unmanned GV, Galaxy, Lodestar *6 boomers: The Generator Advanced hacking: An easy if boring way to help your empire is take towers behind enemy lines. If you take a tower you are distracting troops of the opposing empire or providing a helpful spawn point for your own troops. You can be handy to your empire by being the first into a CC and taking it quickly. Also consider certing uni-MAX and taking one out in an enemy base for some nasty suprises... Also it helps to have a way to replenish your supplies in the field and using adv hacking you can easily get a few aces or anything else you need. Of course you can also steal an enemy tank and if you find one an AMS. Air cav: Some people see this as a MUST HAVE for cloakers. I can see their point as it gives an infiltrator a quick and safeish mode of transportation. The reaver is an undeniably handy and versatile vehicle useful for recannaisance, tank busting, infantry killing, hotdropping, dogfighting....the list goes on. The mossie is a better choice for the infiltrator though because of it's speed, immunity to radar and inbuilt radar makng it the better choice to hotdrop and perhaps infiltrate enemy facilities. Ground support: Both the router and AMS have their uses to the cloaker. Firstly we have the AMS. Because of it's cloaking bubble and equipment terminals it's the obvious choice for a rallying point. Also the fact that you can spawn at it is an obvious plus. However the players that spawn from it are likely to attract attention and the odd OS making it risky. The router's telepad can be a hell of a use for the cloaker as it allows you and you're mates easy access to the enemies base helping you in any objectives you may have. ATV: Now we come to the wraith. It is fast and maneuverable and more importantly invisable which is of course handy for getting from A to B. However it really comes into it's own as a supply depot. It's massive inventory means you can stuff it full of medpacks, ACEs, pistols....anything really. Deploy it near an objective (a bridge that needs mining, a gen that needs dropping, snipers that need killing) and you will see how useful it really is. Why not use an AMS? Well the wraith is less noticable. It is unlikely to be seen by the enemy if you hide it well and even if it is noticed, most people will ignore it anyway. And it is only one cert point with the switchblade, basilisk and fury thrown in too! Bargainous. Uni-MAX: As said above can be very fun if combined with advanced hack. Imagine spawning at a safe base and walking into a deployed dual-cycler max.... ouchie. Also it's nice to make a change now and then. IMPLANTS Darklight: Useful to keep an eye out for the competition. Makes you look kinda stupid if you get stabbed by an enemy cloaker while going for that sniper kill. Although i tend to not kill other cloakes unless they attack me (honour and all that) some people will just go for them and turn into a cloaker hunter. It's really up to your playing style. Sensor shield: I can't stress this enough this is ESSENTIAL FOR ALL CLOAKERS. It stops spits form killing you without you getting a small chance, stops mossies nailing you, nerfs the enemies radar and stops gen pain fields... all these things are useful for the cloaker in their day to day lives (and deaths...). Surge: can be handy if you don't have access to transport or if you are in a tricky situation and need to escape. I tell you a surging infiltrator is difficult to see let alone HIT. I remember when i had it and kept surging out of a surrounded spawn room and dropping boomers behing enemy squads camping the corridors. 5 kills in one go...ouch. Enhanced targetting: You never really notice this one unless it isn't there.... Being able to see health of everything is one of the best abilities in the game. You can see that the lightning over there will explode with one more mine or that sniper will keel over if you whack him with your knife just once.... Being able to see if someone has DL activated is great to and can be a real life saver. Melee booster: This really depends on your play style. Killing someone in only two knife hits is satisfying but this cert is only worth it if you are knifing people constantly. Most people will pass this over in favour of just using a normal melee attack, a pistol, grenade or ACE. Personal shield: I'm sure there are some cloakers who use this but there is no real point. If you get attacked your only real defence is to kill the enemy or run away before they draw their weapon. It's best left to the surgile or rexo players of the world. Audio amplifier: A nice implant for scouts as you can see (or in this case hear) the enemy coming from a while off. This can get you out of many tricky situations but again it depends on your playstyle. If you are spending long times outside hunting AMS', vehicles and snipers you may not have much of a need for this implant. Second wind: Lets face it this isn't the best implant in the world. In fact it's pants. Giving you the slightest of boosts (25 health + 25 stamina) in situations that will probably leave you dead anyway. Even the players who play as grunts and expect to take heavy damage don't take this. Regeneration: Perhaps you may be able to find use for this but that stamina could be used elsewhere (say on DL or SS) and in my personal opinion (and here comes all the pro cloakers laughing at me) if you are shot at you are compromised and probably dead already. If you find you can escape these situations you may find this handy. YOUR TOOLS Knife: The ever handy and versatile knife. If put on secondary can kill agiles and rexos in about 3 swings and if teamed up with melee booster (see above) kills in two. Useful on pheonix users as they are unaware of their surroundings when firing and also useful on snipers. Plasma grenades: Being standard assault all can benefit from these. 3 direct hits if timed correctly takes down an agile/rexo and one direct hit on an infil will kill it dead (needless to say DON'T drop them.) with 30 of them able to fit in your inventory this means you can kill a fair few before having to resupply. HOWEVER the first thing someone will do if plasma grenaded in the middle of nowhere is turn on dark light. The best way to counter this is to sit on towers and walls as for some reson noone will check there. Go figure... Frag grenades: As they make an explosion similar to many, many, many things in ps and make a comparable noise these are stealthier than plasma and do more damage to MAXes and vehicles. However they do less damage to infantry as a tradeoff and it is unlikely that you will be able to kill a MAX or vehicle with it. Probably best to stick with plasma grenades in most (but not all)cases. Jammer grenades: Ahhh the ever useful jammer. It can be used for many things as a cloaker. Stopping someone being able to detect you with DL or AA is the most used one. Also you can use 'em to clear mines or silence spitfires. Stopping tanks firing at you or your mates is great as well. My favourite use for them though is as traps. By sticking down a solid mass of boomers in say, a tech plant vehicle driveway you can blow up pretty much ANYTHING. You can detonate enemy mines to clear CE and blow up enemy tanks in a semi-ironic way or use them to set up explosves around a generator and take it down in one smooth blow. AMP: The automatic machine pistol is useful but not my preferred choice. It can spew out bullets fast and is excellent for close up combat. It however does suffer from massive COF and isn't exactly subtle or covert... I think it does have the shortest TTK though (testing it out soon) so if you get the jump on the enemy you can probably take them down. http://www.phantomphoenix.com/Planetside/TR-Repeater_small.jpg Repeater: Powerful, accurate and long range (for a pistol) this is the closest thing a TR infiltrator gets to a sniper rifle. It can be used to hit enemies from out of DL range and if you are carful you can avoid detection. http://www.phantomphoenix.com/Planetside/NC-MAG-Scatter_small.jpg Mag-scatterpistol: The shotgun-like pistol of the NC is only useful upclose for obvious reasons. It's heavy power means you can easily kill off wounded enemies (which is a little unsporting) or cloakers. It's short range means you have to exercise caution but if used correctly this is a good weapon. http://www.phantomphoenix.com/Planetside/VS-Beamer_small.jpg Beamer: The VS laser-gun-type-thing (technical term) is powerful and fast firing. It is similar to both the AMP and repeater and is cited by a few as the best standard assault pistol available. It's projectiles are easily spotted though meaning you can be asily seen and VS ammo can be hard to find in the field if you run out. These are minor gripes though. Spiker: The ultimate pistol, this is only available if you own core combat. It has potential to have MASSIVE stopping power and it's maelstrom/lasher style lashes make it excellent against tight formations or in indoor combat. It chews up ammo quickly though and has the unfortunate ability of making you light up like an...um...light. Still very worth it though. Laze targetter: Not as useful as it was thanks to the lack of flails these days, this tool used to be very handy. It is still useful for marking targets for OSes, EMPes or bombing strikes. Can be used to point your squad towards an AMS if you find one too. CUD: Obvious uses really so i don't need to say much. EMP is one of the first things to do when you drop from a gal. Med app: Some people carry these in order to keep themselves alive during an infiltration but they take up 1/5 of your inventory losing you space that could be used for an ACE or other useful item. Personally I use Medi-kit drops. I simply stick a couple of med kits in my locker or in the trunk of a vehicle and use them when i need them. I could also hack a term or steal them from other people but this is less likely to attract attention while infiltrating. TACTICS AND GAMEPLAY Keep an eye on what you are doing: If you are playing as an infiltrator and not a cloaker try to keep an objective in mind. The difference being between these two roles is that a cloaker will try to infiltrate an enemy base in order to help his or her empire whereas the cloaker is playing for kills (yes I know these are large generalisations). When infiltrating keep in mind your objectives at all times. For example you may be sneaking into an enemy base to destroy and hold down vehicle terminals or going for a generator drop then remember to head in those directions and try not to get side tracked (this doesn't mean you shouldn't go for targets of oppertunity....Just try to get done what you set out to do). If you are playing as a cloaker then try to keep aware of both your target and the people around him. Many a time have i seen a cloaker being gunned down by someone watching their teammates back. Remember to hide: You are NOT invisible unless you are completely still not using anything. Although it is pathetic some people use a gamma hack to see cloakers a lot easier than usual, however you can easily counter this out in the field. If you see someone who has noticed you pretend you don't know and move to get behind a large hill or rock and lay down a spitfire or two and if you have time a couple of mines. As soon as he gets there he will be shot, exploded and then he is easy pray to a quick knife attack. Grrrr. Also remember to use cover when possible. It makes you harder to see and hit. MORE SOON...

I remember when i had it and kept surging out of a surrounded spawn room and dropping boomers behing enemy squads camping the corridors. 5 kills in one go...ouch. Enhanced targetting: You never really notice this one unless it isn't there.... Being able to see health of everything is one of the best abilities in the game. You can see that the lightning over there will explode with one more mine or that sniper will keel over if you whack him with your knife just once.... Being able to see if someone has DL activated is great to and can be a real life saver. Melee booster: This really depends on your play style. Killing someone in only two knife hits is satisfying but this cert is only worth it if you are knifing people constantly. Most people will pass this over in favour of just using a normal melee attack, a pistol, grenade or ACE. Personal shield: I'm sure there are some cloakers who use this but there is no real point. If you get attacked your only real defence is to kill the enemy or run away before they draw their weapon. It's best left to the surgile or rexo players of the world. Audio amplifier: A nice implant for scouts as you can see (or in this case hear) the enemy coming from a while off. This can get you out of many tricky situations but again it depends on your playstyle. If you are spending long times outside hunting AMS', vehicles and snipers you may not have much of a need for this implant. Second wind: Lets face it this isn't the best implant in the world. In fact it's pants. Giving you the slightest of boosts (25 health + 25 stamina) in situations that will probably leave you dead anyway. Even the players who play as grunts and expect to take heavy damage don't take this. Regeneration: Perhaps you may be able to find use for this but that stamina could be used elsewhere (say on DL or SS) and in my personal opinion (and here comes all the pro cloakers laughing at me) if you are shot at you are compromised and probably dead already. If you find you can escape these situations you may find this handy.","title":"IMPLANTS"},{"location":"Minignus_infiltrator_startup/#your-tools","text":"Knife: The ever handy and versatile knife. If put on secondary can kill agiles and rexos in about 3 swings and if teamed up with melee booster (see above) kills in two. Useful on pheonix users as they are unaware of their surroundings when firing and also useful on snipers. Plasma grenades: Being standard assault all can benefit from these. 3 direct hits if timed correctly takes down an agile/rexo and one direct hit on an infil will kill it dead (needless to say DON'T drop them.) with 30 of them able to fit in your inventory this means you can kill a fair few before having to resupply. HOWEVER the first thing someone will do if plasma grenaded in the middle of nowhere is turn on dark light. The best way to counter this is to sit on towers and walls as for some reson noone will check there. Go figure... Frag grenades: As they make an explosion similar to many, many, many things in ps and make a comparable noise these are stealthier than plasma and do more damage to MAXes and vehicles. However they do less damage to infantry as a tradeoff and it is unlikely that you will be able to kill a MAX or vehicle with it. Probably best to stick with plasma grenades in most (but not all)cases. Jammer grenades: Ahhh the ever useful jammer. It can be used for many things as a cloaker. Stopping someone being able to detect you with DL or AA is the most used one. Also you can use 'em to clear mines or silence spitfires. Stopping tanks firing at you or your mates is great as well. My favourite use for them though is as traps. By sticking down a solid mass of boomers in say, a tech plant vehicle driveway you can blow up pretty much ANYTHING. You can detonate enemy mines to clear CE and blow up enemy tanks in a semi-ironic way or use them to set up explosves around a generator and take it down in one smooth blow. AMP: The automatic machine pistol is useful but not my preferred choice. It can spew out bullets fast and is excellent for close up combat. It however does suffer from massive COF and isn't exactly subtle or covert... I think it does have the shortest TTK though (testing it out soon) so if you get the jump on the enemy you can probably take them down. http://www.phantomphoenix.com/Planetside/TR-Repeater_small.jpg Repeater: Powerful, accurate and long range (for a pistol) this is the closest thing a TR infiltrator gets to a sniper rifle. It can be used to hit enemies from out of DL range and if you are carful you can avoid detection. http://www.phantomphoenix.com/Planetside/NC-MAG-Scatter_small.jpg Mag-scatterpistol: The shotgun-like pistol of the NC is only useful upclose for obvious reasons. It's heavy power means you can easily kill off wounded enemies (which is a little unsporting) or cloakers. It's short range means you have to exercise caution but if used correctly this is a good weapon. http://www.phantomphoenix.com/Planetside/VS-Beamer_small.jpg Beamer: The VS laser-gun-type-thing (technical term) is powerful and fast firing. It is similar to both the AMP and repeater and is cited by a few as the best standard assault pistol available. It's projectiles are easily spotted though meaning you can be asily seen and VS ammo can be hard to find in the field if you run out. These are minor gripes though. Spiker: The ultimate pistol, this is only available if you own core combat. It has potential to have MASSIVE stopping power and it's maelstrom/lasher style lashes make it excellent against tight formations or in indoor combat. It chews up ammo quickly though and has the unfortunate ability of making you light up like an...um...light. Still very worth it though. Laze targetter: Not as useful as it was thanks to the lack of flails these days, this tool used to be very handy. It is still useful for marking targets for OSes, EMPes or bombing strikes. Can be used to point your squad towards an AMS if you find one too. CUD: Obvious uses really so i don't need to say much. EMP is one of the first things to do when you drop from a gal. Med app: Some people carry these in order to keep themselves alive during an infiltration but they take up 1/5 of your inventory losing you space that could be used for an ACE or other useful item. Personally I use Medi-kit drops. I simply stick a couple of med kits in my locker or in the trunk of a vehicle and use them when i need them. I could also hack a term or steal them from other people but this is less likely to attract attention while infiltrating.","title":"YOUR TOOLS"},{"location":"Minignus_infiltrator_startup/#tactics-and-gameplay","text":"Keep an eye on what you are doing: If you are playing as an infiltrator and not a cloaker try to keep an objective in mind. The difference being between these two roles is that a cloaker will try to infiltrate an enemy base in order to help his or her empire whereas the cloaker is playing for kills (yes I know these are large generalisations). When infiltrating keep in mind your objectives at all times. For example you may be sneaking into an enemy base to destroy and hold down vehicle terminals or going for a generator drop then remember to head in those directions and try not to get side tracked (this doesn't mean you shouldn't go for targets of oppertunity....Just try to get done what you set out to do). If you are playing as a cloaker then try to keep aware of both your target and the people around him. Many a time have i seen a cloaker being gunned down by someone watching their teammates back. Remember to hide: You are NOT invisible unless you are completely still not using anything. Although it is pathetic some people use a gamma hack to see cloakers a lot easier than usual, however you can easily counter this out in the field. If you see someone who has noticed you pretend you don't know and move to get behind a large hill or rock and lay down a spitfire or two and if you have time a couple of mines. As soon as he gets there he will be shot, exploded and then he is easy pray to a quick knife attack. Grrrr. Also remember to use cover when possible. It makes you harder to see and hit. MORE SOON...

Category:Modules","title":"Module benefit"},{"location":"Modules/","text":", Speed , and Equipment Modules in their cradles in an Interlink Facility ]] Modules are devices that can be obtained from the Module Buildings in the Caverns introduced by the expansion Core Combat . When installed inside a surface base facility , modules grant the facility and the controlling empire a module benefit (apart from Facility Linked Benefits ), depending on the type of module installed. In order to obtain a module, one must go to the caverns, capture a Module Building , obtain a non-powered module, and take it to the Core Complex to be charged. Once the module is removed from the Module Building , the player has fifteen minutes to charge the module and bring it to the surface. Once on the surface, the player has an additional fifteen minutes to install the module into a friendly base. Once the module is placed in a Module Cradle , all bases linked to the module will receive the benefits. Each Empire has a limit of 10 Modules that they can have installed at any given time. If exceeded, the only way to gain more modules is to steal them from enemy bases that have them. Also, only three modules can be in-transit in a cave at the same time. More modules cannot be taken from their cradles until at least one is taken to the surface or the timer expires on one. Taking a non-charged module to the surface causes the module to disappear. If a charged Module is still in the cave when an enemy empire captures the Module Building it was taken from, the module will explode instantly, regardless of the timer. Note: when carrying a module, your character will \"flash\" the color of the module you picked up. Also, similar to the LLU , an icon will appear on the map giving the location of you and the module for both friendlies and enemies to see, thus it's best to have an escort to avoid an enemy from stealing the module. A module icon flashing green means a friendly has picked it up. A red flashing icon means an enemy has it, and a black flashing icon means the module is on the ground. If the fifteen minute timer expires on the module, it will start beeping a different sound and explode after a random delay between 1 second and 5 minutes, killing the carrier and anything nearby. Available Modules ]] Currently, six types of modules are available to be installed (map icon color is listed): Equipment Module (blue) Health Module (yellow) Pain Module (beige) Shield Module (aqua) Speed Module (orange) Vehicle Module (purple) Empires may also try to achieve a Cavern Lock which will provide all six module benefits to any linked or chain linked facility as if they had a module installed. Special Rules The modules are unique constructs, and are subject to several special rules, in the same vein as LLUs . Once installed in a facility, they cannot be removed by friendlies under normal circumstances. This is to prevent griefing . However, friendlies can remove modules from their own base if the enemy has the facility under hack . Once installed at a facility, modules can only be stolen by enemies if one of two things happen. If the facility 's Control Console is hacked . If the facility's generator is destroyed. If the facility where the module is installed reverts to a neutral state, the module is destroyed, as it has no power. Once installed at a facility, the module has a complete lifetime of roughly 28 hours, which is also the cavern rotation cycle's time period. The modules are extremely sensitive to changes in pressure. If a module is ever submerged in water, it will immediately detonate, destroying itself and anything near it.

Especially you Newb Uni-MAX owners. The TR MAX units, in my opinion are the best in the game. Although they are underpowered compared to the other factions MAX units during normal operations their special ability (liability and asset) to anchor down makes them incredibly powerful. I will comment on each of the armament types seperately. AA MAX: BURSTER his MAX has the unique ability to target and often seal the fate of enemy aircraft before they even know what hit them. This is due to the fact that the flak MAX is dumb fire mode only. Since it has no missle lock warning, this MAX can fire (especially at range) all the projectiles required to destroy the aircraft before the first shell explodes. To be effectively employed you must find an area to anchor down that avoids exposure to enemy fire and allows you to overlook an area where aircraft will be spwawning, repairing, or hovering (ie around bases that are under siege). Then you just have to anchor down and wait for your chance. I recommend finding high ground whenever possible. The splash (explosion) radius of the rounds when they approach an enemy aircraft will allow you to target aircraft around bases even when they are seeking cover or can no longer be seen. This MAX weapon is truly only effective against aircraft. Remember this when you think about attacking that armored vehicle... you are going to lose. If you get surprised by a softie, even in the rexo suit you can win a one on one battle provided you do some straffing and the opponent doesnt have anti vehicular weapons. Once again though, you will be damaged a lot and likely be killed soon after. AV MAX: POUNDER This is the best all purpose MAX for the TR. The mortar projectiles do substantial damage to personnel and aircraft (although hard to hit) in addition to vehicles and MAX units. I cant swear to this but I am not sure that any other MAX has a faster time to kill (TTK) then the Pounder when it is anchored. For that matter if you are anchored in the AV MAX I would engage anything that appears in front of you if good cover/escape isnt easily and quickly available. The reason for this is, first you will likely die thrying to escape anything you arent willing to engage anyways. Secondly the Pounder does so much damage to most targets that you will mortally wound, drive away or destroy many targets if you just get to work on killing them. Dont think I am crazy... you will almost always lose to Reavers, Gunships, Tanks, and BFRs. However, if you are anchored and get the drop on an enemy you will be amazed how quickly you can kill them. Try to find enemies that are already engaged with other friendlies. If you can get the first full magazine on target before they recognize you the enemy vehicle will most likely bail out of the fight or be destroyed. This MAX is also great for any area where there is a bottle neck. It pairs well with the dual cycler for back door, tower and other doorway defenses where the explosion damage almost guarantees hits. Dont forget that even though the indirect fire of this weapon makes hitting difficult it also can allow you to attack enemy vehicles over base walls. The secondary fire mode (three second delay) is useful for clearing out hallways and to a lesser degree bouncing around corners. AI MAX: DUAL CYCLER Finally we come to the anti-infantry max for the TR. This weapon (like all TR weapons) has a high rate of fire and large magazine size. The weapon is extremely effective against soft targets and is capable of dizzing rate of fire. One issue with this weapon system is knowing when to anchor and when not to. The combination of armor and damage to softies allows you to win almost any one on one battle (and many against multiple enemies)... damn decimators, not fond of the lancer either... at close to medium range. You can use this to incredible effect in close confined quarters. You do suffer damage degredation at range so keep this in mind. Please save your time and help out the TR by not getting carried away... although it seems like you can take on anything (lasers and muzzle flash are sweet) you have little chance against anything other then softies. I have destroyed noob mosquito pilots when anchored but I dont recommend attacking anything but softies. What will happen is... their damage indicator (red directional flashes) will blow up due to the number of hits and they will then turn and kill you. I wouldnt even use it against other MAXs unless you have to. Strategy tips... We all know that the decimator, phoenix, and lancer will kill you in no time flat. We all know you are a big target and draw a lot of attention due to the amount of hurt you can put out and the fact that you are fairly easy to kill. We should all know that a MAX suit makes you want to charge in all doors and take on all armor, which is a bad idea. This could go on forever but this isnt about general MAX strategy. On to the other TR issue... To Anchor or not to Anchor : If you have played (or read about) a TR MAX then you know that the ability to anchor is a gift and a curse. On the one hand you shrink your cone of fire, and almost double the rate of fire. On the other you become stationary, and loose the ability to fire and address any threat that isnt in front of you. I will make this as simple as possible since your playing style and experience will teach you more about this decision then anything I can write. Basically, if you are defending an area, or entrance way you should anchor down. if you have other supporting TR with you to guard your back or a wall is handy (to guard your back) anchor down. If you sneak up on, get the jump on, or see an opportunity to really throw down on a target anchor down. If you know you are going to die and are trying to take as many with you as you can, anchor down. The harder part is learning when not to. If you can easily be flanked, dont have cover to your rear or are surprised by a superior enemy (ie, tank, BFR, AV troop) dont anchor down. Also beware of hallways where you can be easily hit \"stick and move\" style with decimators. In short, I have gotten more kills by far when anchored down and giving them hell then I ever have just standing up and staying mobile. When in the thick of battle, I must also say that along with those kills, anchoring has dramaticly shortened my life expectency. AMENDMENT: A recent change to Terran MAXs... The powers at be have added a max capacitor which allows a noticible increase in rate of fire without anchoring down. It is all or nothing (once initiated it cant be stopped) and gives a valuable new resource to users. Although fairly short in duration the capacitor ability gives you the oportunity push forward while laying down increased firepower. This ability is quite usefull when pushing into spawn rooms, up tower stairs, and attacking CCs. I havent had enough of a chance to use it to issue a verdict. Good luck with the new tool. Enjoy the firepower TR and happy hunting. -- Mudwink 13:40, 31 October 2007 (EDT)Mudwink Category:Strategy","title":"Mudwink"},{"location":"Mukuru/","text":"Bio Lab Mukuru is situated alone on a small island in Southwest Cyssor , which it shares only with its single Tower .

You can also refill friendly NTU Silos in this mode, assuming you have filled your capacitor. Similar to an ANT , you will recieve BEP for filling friendly silos. For every 2 NTUs you siphon, only 1 unit can be put back into a friendly base. A BFR with two full siphons can fill a base to approximately 30%. A BFR can only use one NTU Siphon at a time, but can equip Siphons on both arms. The second mode is the EMP mode. The Siphon must have at least 30 NTUs gathered in the primary mode to use as an EMP. When activated, an EMP is expelled (identical to one called by a CUD ). An EMP can only be expelled every 20 seconds or so. Jammer Grenades and EMP blasts will disable the NTU Siphon completely for a short time (unlike traditional BFR weapons that simply receive rate of fire penalties). Uses for this weapon include draining enemy NTUs to drain the base quicker, using the EMP to clear mines, and using the EMP in conjuction with an Armor Siphon to attack enemy BFRs .

I go by the alias [NeoPhoenixTR](http://www.planetsidestats.net/players.php?world_id=15&char_id=751022)(NeoPhoenixTE on the [forums](http://comms.planetsidesyndicate.com/member.php?userid=144), [Wiki](user:NeoPhoenixTE.md), and the rest of the net), and my main character is an [Emerald](Emerald.md) [TR](Terran_Republic.md) [CR5](Command_Rank.md). I have been playing PlanetSide for nearly two years now, but have always been mediocre at shooter games overall. My expertise comes in niche strategies and multitasking... just not aiming. \\>\\_\\> Ever since [BFRs](BattleFrame_Robotics.md) were first brought into the game, I have had a constant fascination with them. True, some of this has come from my personal love of the \"mecha\" genre of Anime, but it was also a new dimension to the game. Many hated them, and still hate them, and that saddens me. Despite what many may think, I love BFRs. However, like everything in my life, the more I like something, the more I like to break it. I work on computers and networks for a living...and I literally learned everything by breaking, well, everything. Sometime ago, the [Markov](Markov.md) TR named [Blahman](http://www.planetsidestats.net/players.php?world_id=3&char_id=384070) released a [movie showing how to destroy a BFR as a solo grunt](http://www.planetsidemovies.com/modules.php?name=Downloads&d_op=viewdownloaddetails&lid=1088&title=How_to_Solo_a_BFR.wmv). I watched this movie, and it got me to thinking about his approach. Soon after, I had found myself dropping on BFRs and destroying them, each drop giving me more experience for the next. It has been well over five months since then, allowing me to alter and perfect the simple methods in Blahman's movie into a more precise and effective method. Most BFR pilots on Emerald know of my incessant love of \"BFR Hunting\" (or \"jihading\" as people call it, but I _hate_ that term and wish it would get replaced). In some cases, these pilots have come to fear this technique and my name, despite the fact this was never the intent, ever. I was just bored and found something I'm good at. :( I am the first holder of the [BFR Buster Platinum Merit](BFR_Buster.md) and have over 850 BFRs kills recorded using the technique I will describe on this page. So, suffice it to say, this technique works. Those of you who wish to witness this technique in action are welcome to watch my movie: [Rampage of the BFR Hunter](http://www.planetsidemovies.com/modules.php?name=Downloads&d_op=getit&lid=2170). About this guide This handbook will attempt to explain the \"art form\" of BFR Hunting. Why am I writing something so long? It seems people always ask me how I do this, or how I do that, or what I recommend, or what about this. This handbook is to answer every last one of those questions, and give recommendations. I will be updating this guide over time (hopefully not _too_ long) as I go. Like I said, should answer any questions I get (and make them stop :\\|). A second answer to that question could be that I like information. I like having it, and I like making it. I compile stats for my outfit, [KAAOS](KAAOS.md), about our outfit nights and turn it into a 1-page overview once the numbers are available from [Rev's PlanetSide Stats page](http://www.planetsidestats.net), and use it to draw conclusions on our performance that night. I'm just an information nut is all. I also like helping people out. During the writing of this guide, I have gotten alot of good comments and critiques on it. People have loved it as I write it, and I love writing it for people. During it's writing I had shown it to my outfit, people who visit the [Syndicate Comms](http://comms.planetsidesyndicate.com/), as well as very few select people who have wanted to get into BFR Hunting who weren't part of the first two groups. ;) This guide is scheduled for public [official forum](Planetside_Official_Forums.md) release upon completion. Released to public on 6/7/2005. Enjoy the guide! -Neo NOEDITSECTION Section 1: BFR Hunting's Point and Purpose \"BFR Hunting\" is the process of seeking out enemy BattleFrame units and destroying them. The purpose of this is to remove these units from the field, allowing your empire's frames to gain an advantage in the struggle. Other purposes of Hunting include: Battle Experience Points , the BFR Buster Merit , and \"fame\" of being a skilled BFR Hunter. All BFRs have a 20-minute timer on average, meaning any BFR that you destroy is out of comission for a long time. This will allow for your own empire's BattleFrames gain an advantage in the armor war for continental domination. BFR Hunters, though often percieved as soloists who care not for their empire, can prove invaluable in the fight. Even if there is only one or two of them, BFR Hunters can help to turn a battle completely around via attrition. Such power takes practice and dedication; that is why this guide is so blinkin' long and detailed. There's more to BFR Hunting than simply dropping and shooting. Section 2: The Tools of the Trade This section will describe the basic essentials needed for BFR Hunting Certifications Required Certs In order to begin hunting, the following certs are required : Air Cavalry Scout + Assault Anti-Vehicular This technique involves bailing from your aircraft onto the target battleframe, and Aircav is the fastest and most effective way to approach BFRs. Both levels are required due to the fact that if you repeat this technique, you will get a vehicle timer! Anti-Vehicular is what is used to make the kill itself. Optimal Certs The following certs are optimal for BFR Hunting: Heavy Assault Advanced Hacking Heavy Assault is utilized in self-defense during a takedown. Best to have the better gun. Advanced hacking is for when the pilot gets out, and you end up killing them. Why leave an empty enemy frame there when you can bring it to your side? Optional Certs The following certs are nowhere close to required, but can make a dedicated BFR Hunter's life easier: ATV Harasser ATV and Harasser serve as a way to keep yourself from ever waiting at a vehicle pad. Though these vehicles are not as effective as Air Cavalry for sneaking up on BFRs, experienced BFR Hunters can use these methods for a \"balls out\" approach. Both vehicles are also a ton of fun, and the harasser can be used to assist in core module and LLU runs when you're not hunting. Implants Required/Recommended Implants For hunting, the only implant you need is Surge . However, as a personal recommendation, here are the implants I employ in my personal hunting: Surge Enhanced Targeting Second Wind Surge will be used to catch up to target battleframes. Enhanced Targeting is effective at picking your targets wisely. Second Wind helps to keep your stamina and health up for enough time to squeeze the killshot off. Implants to Avoid Implants to avoid using are: Personal Shield Darklight The reasoning behing my recommendation against personal shield is that, during a takedown, stamina is essential . Darklight is also a stamina hog, and serves no useful purpose during both a hunt and takedown. Like I said before, these implants would be better off replaced with advanced targeting and second wind. It's really up to you and your own personal playstyle as to what you do with your other two implant slots. Knowledge There are a few basic things you need to know before even starting to hunt. These things are taught in my outfit, KAAOS ' training courses, thus why I will tell anyone that wants to attend a live training session to undergo the outfit's training. This section will only talk about the basic essential knowledge. Drop Animation & Guiding The first bit of knowledge you need to know is how to kill the drop animation after bailing from an aircraft. When you bail from an aircraft, your client will enter a \"cutscene\" of sorts, showing your character dropping down with the kinetic dampender effect trailing behind it. This animation kills your field of vison while you are dropping, and leaves you an open target to anyone that spots you as you fall. There is a way to bypass this animation, and that is by simply taking your gun out after you bail. Taking your gun out will put you back in a first-person view, and it will allow you to look around, and even fire your weapon on the way down. While you are in the first person view, you can also guide your drop by simply moving around. Point your reticle in the direction you wish to fall towards, and simply move forward. This can also be helped by using the surge implant that you have in order to make more significant adjustments. Flight Basics Like stated earlier, this approach requires the use of Aircav. In orer to utilize it properly, one must know the basics of operating a Reaver and Mosquito , including: Basic Movement Afterburner Use Weapon Use (to defend yourself) Basic movement is just pretty much knowing where to move your mouse/joystick to go where, and how to hover and descend. Know the controls for your aircraft, and practice flying around. Afterburner use refers to knowing when to use your afterburners, and how to utilize them correctly. A few tips: Don't burn it all at once, use enough of it to get the speed you want, and then lay off Fire in bursts to conserve your afterburner You can afterburn all the way into a warpgate . Your afterburner will be fully replenished when you emerge on the other side. Weapon use is literally just practicing your aim with the chaingun and rocket launcher on the aircraft. You'll need to know this in situations in which you need to defend your bird. \"The Force\" Like with everything in this game, one must attune a sense of situational awareness while hunting. You must be able to \"feel out\" where everything is simply by glancing at it. Despite how much this sounds like \"Use the Force, Luke\" , it's actually true. This kind of awareness can only be acquired by experience within PlanetSide, any shooter game, as well as life itself. Without it, you will find yourself as nothing more than a standing target that everyone will stare at, laugh at, and, of course, shoot at. (Personal Note: Towards the beginning of my BFR Hunter \"career\", I had been diagnosed with Adult ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder). During this time, I had learned that ADD minds are simply wired differently, and process thought in a different way. After some therapy and medication, I had found my situational awareness increased. Just a note for those of you who may actually have ADD. All those jerks that teased you in game about it...go blow up their BattleFrames. ;D) Kiss your K/D Goodbye Dedicated BFR Hunters die, and they die alot. In fact, they always die more than they kill (unless it's been a really really really good night). If you are out to have a positive K/D ratio, I warn you now, this guide wont tell you how to get it. True, your BEP count will likely skyrocket, but you'll be spending over 60% of your time respawning and getting back in the air. BFR Hunting can be frustrating, and often times, it is very frustrating. Just know that BFR Hunting isn't for everyone, and it'll get you a lot of stress if you take it seriously. This is why I recommend a break every 10 drops or so, just to keep the mind fresh and to get some air. Section 3: The Deci-Swap Technique Another bit of knowledge one must know is the Deci-Swap Technique. This technique is used to increase the firing rate of the Decimator by swapping it with another, and is essential to taking down BFRs. UPDATE: This technique has been removed from the game, invalidating the majority of this guide. This guide is now simply an archive of a past strategy. This technique appears as an exploit to many people . However, there are also those of the opinion that it is no less dirty than mastering the use of the tripleshot Jackhammer , and even see it as a skill that requires alot of practice to master. There are a few choice threads on the Official Forums talking about the morality of using the Deci-Swap technique, but this section isn't about how \"legal\" Deci-Swapping is. Let's move on to what this section is about. Inventory Loadout The first step to learning this technique is knowing the type of loadout to use when BFR Hunting. The loadouts presented here are recommended loadouts, meaning you can adjust them as you see fit. Required Items There are rules that must be followed when building loadouts: You must carry at least three (3) Decimators You must carry at least one (1) Jammer Grenade You must be in Agile Armor Three Decimators give you a total of nine shots. Typical Gunner Variant BFRs take 4-5 decimator shots. This is assuming you hit the armor with every shot. While this only requires 2 decimators, the third one is needed for the deci-swap technique itself (plus it's insurance for those of us with either bad aim or lousy pings). The one jammer grenade is needed to slow a BFR to a speed in which it can be engaged, as well as disable a few systems, rendering it an easy target. Agile armor is required due to the fact that you cannot pilot an aircraft in Rexo , and the inventory space of both the Infiltrator and Standard Armor is insufficient to carry your payload. The Poor Man's Loadout ![Image:BFRHunter-MALoadout.gif](BFRHunter-MALoadout.md.gif \"fig:Image:BFRHunter-MALoadout.gif\") Example of a \"Poor Man's Loadout\" The first loadout described is for those who don't have the certs for [Heavy Assault](Heavy_Assault.md). This is good for characters who are at very low [Battle Ranks](Battle_Rank.md) that need to make some quick [BEP](Battle_Experience_Points.md) by hunting. The loadout to the left satisfies the minimum conditions with the 3 Decimators, and the Jammer. Also, note that the first Decimator is in the active rifle (or number 2) holster. The [Sweeper Shotgun](Sweeper.md) is a good choice for a defensive weapon from the [Medium Assault](Medium_Assault.md) pool. It specializes in close-combat, and is common-pool, so the price is right. The [REK](Remote_Electronics_Kit.md) is totally optional. It's recommended if you have [Advanced Hacking](Advanced_Hacking.md), and it's also a good idea to keep a REK on you at all times anyways. ;) **WARNING!** _Make sure your defensive weapon is loaded with standard (white) ammo! AP (gold) ammo wont help you here!_ An important thing to note in this loadout is the spacing indicated in the picture by the yellow box. Make sure you leave that spacing there, meaning putting your gun all the way on the left side of the inventory backpack. The reasoning behind this space is simple. When you swap your defensive weapon (the Sweeper in this case) into your active rifle holster, you wont drop the Decimator that was in your active holster while in combat. Resist that urge to put a second jammer, pistol-sized item, or even box of ammo in there. That jammer, pistol, or ammo could cost you the kill later on. The Optimal Loadout ![Image:BFRHunter-HALoadout.gif](BFRHunter-HALoadout.md.gif \"fig:Image:BFRHunter-HALoadout.gif\") Example of an Optimal BFR Hunter Loadout The second loadout described is for those who have advanced a few Battle Ranks and can afford the big guns. This is the loadout I personally use when BFR hunting. Since we're now using Heavy Assault weapons, the common-pool weaponry is out the window. This is where problems can occur between empires. Given the empire-specific weapons, the [TR](Terran_Republic.md) and the [NC](New_Conglomerate.md) have the best defensive HA weapons, while the [VS](Vanu_Sovereignty.md) are at a disadvantage. The TR's [Mini-Chaingun](Mini-Chaingun.md) has a 100 bullet clip that is capable of killing 2-3 grunts before running dry. The NC's [Jackhammer](Jackhammer.md) is like the Sweeper, but bigger, specializing in close-combat. The VS' [Lasher](Lasher.md), however, only has 25 shots, and is at a disadvantage outdoors, where any BFR takedown will be taking place. My recommendation is that any VS BFR Hunter stick to the Sweeper used in the \"Poor Man's Loadout\" described earlier. **WARNING!** _Make sure your defensive weapon is loaded with standard (white) ammo! AP (gold) ammo wont help you here!_ (yes, second time, it's _that_ important) Something noted in the last section, the Decimator in the active rifle holster by defeault, is also present in this loadout. The reasoning behind this is that you need to be firing a Decimator first when you land on your target. This placement saves time and effort later on from not having to swap out your defensive weapon for a Decimator. This makes more sense in the next section. The Technique Itself Enough about how to setup your loadouts. Time to get on with the moves! HUD Setup ![Image:BFRHunter-CursorPosition.gif](BFRHunter-CursorPosition.md.gif \"fig:Image:BFRHunter-CursorPosition.gif\") Mouse cursor position at the start of a Deci-Swap There are two things you must do before attempting the Deci-Swap Technique: - Bind your inventory key to something _very_ close and easy (mine is set to \"R\" using the WASD setup) - Have your mouse cursor in position to swap The Deci-Swap technique requires you to be able to open your inventory, right click, and close your inventory again all within a 2-second window. Having your cursor in this postion before opening your inventory will allow you to do this. Before challenging a BFR, open your inventory, and place your cursor on one of the other Decimators like the one in the picture is. Then close your inventory. Next time you open your invetory window, your mouse cursor will still be there. **WARNING!** _Going into your map between setting your cursor and opening it again for the Deci-Swap will reset the cursor's postion to center!_ This is where being nervous and/or obsessive compulsive can save your butt! Keep flicking your inventory while en-route to a target to check the postioning...as well as get all that nervous energy out in your little finger there. Fire-Swap-Pull-Fire Okay! You've gotten the loadout, you've setup your HUD...now for the technique itself! ![Image:BFRHunter-CursorMovement.gif](BFRHunter-CursorMovement.md.gif \"fig:Image:BFRHunter-CursorMovement.gif\") Mouse Movement during the Deci-Swap The Deci-Swap is basically this: - Pull out your Decimator and fire it - Pull up your inventory - Swap a new Deci in by right-clicking on one in your inventory - Close your inventory - Pull out your (new) Decimator and fire it - Repeat Sounds easy, doesn't it. Did I mention the entire cycle should take no more than 3 seconds? Yeah, my hand's cramping too. During this process, during one of your swaps (the 3rd or 4th shot at latest), you need to move your mouse cursor (as shown in the picture) to the \"third deci\" to swap in. The reasoning behind this (and why you even brought that third Decimator) is that you need to keep firing off Decimators at this accelerated rate. If you keep swapping the same two Decimators, they will both run out, and you'll be stuck firing that third one at \"normal\" speeds (which you may as well just point at the ground cause you are likely screwed by now). Swap the third one in to simply delay the ammo running dry on the other two so you always have two Decimators to fire. Practicing Chances are you're still reading the last section, especially the part about doing all that within 3 seconds per cycle. Once you've torn yourself away from that, you're probably gonna call me insane and tell me no man alive can do it that fast. Well, go check out the movie I posted at the top of this article, and then tell me it's impossible. The most important part of the Deci-Swap technique is practicing it. Doing something that complex in such a short amount of time requires practice. With enough practice, the Deci-Swap Technique can become like walking, or typing. And with practice, your speed will increase. Don't expect to completely \"wtfpwn\" the first BFR you challenge with this technique. Good chance you will fumble the swap, drop a decimator, or get stuck in mouse cursor mode while trying to aim. I still do to this day. :\\ Here's a couple scenarios that I recommend for Deci-Swap practice. ![Image:BFRHunter-RexoPracticeLoadout.gif](BFRHunter-RexoPracticeLoadout.md.gif \"fig:Image:BFRHunter-RexoPracticeLoadout.gif\") Rexo Loadout for Deci-Swap Combat Practice In Private First you get some lotion, and then- Find a good quiet place, such as a backline base, or even VR, and just practice the motions. Do it at whatever speed your are comfortable with, and constantly try to increase your speed as it starts to feel more natural. In time, you won't even need to read any notes. You'll just be able to do it! I recommend getting comfortable in this environment before moving onto the next one. Combat Practice It's great that you can deci-swap like a champ in a quiet room...but how about when there's gunfire, yelling, and people all around you that want to kill you? Yeah, your concentration may get a bit frayed then. Try to pack two Decimators in your standard grunt loadouts, and practice the swap against MAX units (and enjoy the \"hax\" tells!) While this wont let you practice switching to the \"third Deci,\" it will allow you to get the motions down while in head-to-head combat. **REXO WARNING!** _Make sure you have your Decimator in your first active rifle holster (number 2 again). Any Rifle-sized item you swap in will go into that rifle holster!_ This type of practice is the kind the average grunt may be doing already. This same technique has been used to bypass the refire time of a [Bolt Driver](Bolt_Driver.md), much like it bypasses the Decimator refire time. Another fun way to practice that _does_ let you practice the \"third Deci\" is to use an enemy [Generator](Generator.md) as a test dummy for your BFR Hunter loadout. Simply load up your agile loadout, wait for surge, surge through to the enemy gen, and swap away while blasting that gen. See how fast you can swap all three with the thought of your pursuing foes in your head. Section 4: Hunting BattleFrames You got your loadout, you got your moves, now you just need your target: Enemy BattleFrames. Defensive Flying The main approach to BFRs, like stated earlier, is Air Cavalry . So, let's start with how to proceed to your targets. Use The World Unless you happen to be an ace pilot as well as a BFR Hunter, you should try t stay out of sight. Best way to do this is to use the world to hide yourself. Few quick tips: Fly high on Ishundar and Hossin. The fog hides your aircraft well on both these continents. (You just have to get low enough to see your target when it's time) Use hills and third person. Hills provide excellent cover from being spotted, and even shot at. You can even hide behind a ridge and flick to third person to see over it. This is especially useful on Ceryshen by floating just under a ledge, and \"ledge camping\" with your aircraft. The Scenic Route If you cannot use the world for cover, avoid it all together. Avoid roads and direct \"as the crow flies\" routes between bases. Fly out over the water Avoid areas where you yourself would fly between objectives. The overall objective of this kinda defensive flying is to not be spotted. Not being spotted keeps your bird alive enough so you can bail on your target. Should you be spotted and get engaged by enemy aircraft, you can either run for it and try to bail on the closest target BFR you can find, or you can try to fight your way out of it. It's really up to you and your own personal skill as a pilot. \"The Game Trails\" It's good to avoid the enemy...but where do you seek the target? Every continent and battle has a series of \"Game Trails.\" These are areas where BFRs will be moving to and from targets. They are also places where large armor conflicts could be taking place. Good \"Game trail\" examples include: Bridges (especally the Ceryshen bridge between Sedna and Anguta) Roads Direct land routes between two bases Areas between towers and their respective base But, these aren't the only places. This is where use of \"The Force\" may be needed. You need to be able to \"feel out\" your enemy. Quite literally asking \"If I were a BFR pilot looking for kills, where would I go and how would I get there?\" It may be common sense, but, alot of people tend to look for BFRs just at towers and bases. Even though they often are there, it's always best to catch them on the way there in the middle of nowhere where they are (preferably) without their support troops and vehicles. Picking the target As if the corny \"game trail\" terminology wasn't enough, I offer this phrase to start: \"Think like a Lion...strike like a Lion...\" Lions are hunters in the wild, and the fact that you are hunting BattleFrames (in the wild no less) means that you and a Lion can follow the same three rules: Pick on the slow Pick on the sick/wounded Pick on the ignorant Picking on the slow would mean targetting gunner variants. These variants have alot of armor, but can't outrun infantry while jammed. Picking on the sick and wounded would mean finding a damaged BFR, and finishing it off. This would require use of the Enhanced Targeting implant to spot low health bars, or just a keen sense of how hurt a BFR is simply by how it moves. If a BFR is running away from a target, good chance that it's probably hurt, or at least in no shape to attack. This also applies to enemy frames that are under attack by friendly forces. I myself tend to drop in on a BFR being targetting by my own empire, seeking both the kill and the glorious cheers from teammates. (Some actually calling it a \"priviledge to watch the legend at work!\" Do KingAildiyan and Ash go through this? seriously) Picking on the ignorant, despite how cruel it may seem, is just as effective. If you see a BFR that's doing something that makes it an easy target (such as a flight variant crouching while camping or a gunner variant camping against a wall), attack it! Who knows, the enemy may thank you for raising their collective average IQ a little. ;) Section 5: The Takedown Dropping Placement You're on the ground, now what? It's time to make use of surge and head for the sweet spot! These are ideal placements for you to be during a takedown. Against Terran Republic Frames Placement under a TR [Colossus](Colossus.md) or [Invader](Invader.md) Description here Against New Conglomerate Frames Placement under an NC [Peregrine](Peregrine.md) or [Eagle](Eagle.md) Description here Against Vanu Sovereignty Frames Placement behind a VS [Aphelion](Aphelion.md) or [Eclipse](Eclipse.md) Description here Aiming You're in the sweet spot, now where do you shove that deci-swap? Well, that all depends on what kind of BFR you are fighting. Here are recommended spots to aim during the deci-swap and the takedown. Against Terran Republic Frames ![Image:ColossusTakedownAim.gif](ColossusTakedownAim.md.gif \"fig:Image:ColossusTakedownAim.gif\") Where to aim against a TR [Colossus](Colossus.md) or [Invader](Invader.md) Like alot of things in the guide thusfar, this should seem common sense. However, there are people who think they have to do some weird things. Let's just clarify here. You _do not_ need to nail these things in the legs. If properly executed, and done quickly, the yellow box in the picture is the only place, as well as the safest place, to aim your deci-swap shots. You will annhilate their trunk, their sensors, possibly the flight pod on an Invader, and the gunner pod on a Colossus. Though, the ultimate goal is to just blow every last component up, down to the last nut and bolt. Keeping your aim restricted to this box is a good way to make sure every decimator hits the frame, and delivers its payload.

The purpose of this is to remove these units from the field, allowing your empire's frames to gain an advantage in the struggle. Other purposes of Hunting include: Battle Experience Points , the BFR Buster Merit , and \"fame\" of being a skilled BFR Hunter. All BFRs have a 20-minute timer on average, meaning any BFR that you destroy is out of comission for a long time. This will allow for your own empire's BattleFrames gain an advantage in the armor war for continental domination. BFR Hunters, though often percieved as soloists who care not for their empire, can prove invaluable in the fight. Even if there is only one or two of them, BFR Hunters can help to turn a battle completely around via attrition. Such power takes practice and dedication; that is why this guide is so blinkin' long and detailed.

When you bail from an aircraft, your client will enter a \"cutscene\" of sorts, showing your character dropping down with the kinetic dampender effect trailing behind it. This animation kills your field of vison while you are dropping, and leaves you an open target to anyone that spots you as you fall. There is a way to bypass this animation, and that is by simply taking your gun out after you bail. Taking your gun out will put you back in a first-person view, and it will allow you to look around, and even fire your weapon on the way down. While you are in the first person view, you can also guide your drop by simply moving around. Point your reticle in the direction you wish to fall towards, and simply move forward. This can also be helped by using the surge implant that you have in order to make more significant adjustments.","title":"Drop Animation &amp; Guiding"},{"location":"NeoPhoenixTR/#flight-basics","text":"Like stated earlier, this approach requires the use of Aircav. In orer to utilize it properly, one must know the basics of operating a Reaver and Mosquito , including: Basic Movement Afterburner Use Weapon Use (to defend yourself) Basic movement is just pretty much knowing where to move your mouse/joystick to go where, and how to hover and descend. Know the controls for your aircraft, and practice flying around. Afterburner use refers to knowing when to use your afterburners, and how to utilize them correctly. A few tips: Don't burn it all at once, use enough of it to get the speed you want, and then lay off Fire in bursts to conserve your afterburner You can afterburn all the way into a warpgate . Your afterburner will be fully replenished when you emerge on the other side. Weapon use is literally just practicing your aim with the chaingun and rocket launcher on the aircraft.

This kind of awareness can only be acquired by experience within PlanetSide, any shooter game, as well as life itself. Without it, you will find yourself as nothing more than a standing target that everyone will stare at, laugh at, and, of course, shoot at. (Personal Note: Towards the beginning of my BFR Hunter \"career\", I had been diagnosed with Adult ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder). During this time, I had learned that ADD minds are simply wired differently, and process thought in a different way. After some therapy and medication, I had found my situational awareness increased.

UPDATE: This technique has been removed from the game, invalidating the majority of this guide. This guide is now simply an archive of a past strategy. This technique appears as an exploit to many people . However, there are also those of the opinion that it is no less dirty than mastering the use of the tripleshot Jackhammer , and even see it as a skill that requires alot of practice to master. There are a few choice threads on the Official Forums talking about the morality of using the Deci-Swap technique, but this section isn't about how \"legal\" Deci-Swapping is. Let's move on to what this section is about.","title":"Section 3: The Deci-Swap Technique"},{"location":"NeoPhoenixTR/#inventory-loadout","text":"The first step to learning this technique is knowing the type of loadout to use when BFR Hunting. The loadouts presented here are recommended loadouts, meaning you can adjust them as you see fit.","title":"Inventory Loadout"},{"location":"NeoPhoenixTR/#required-items","text":"There are rules that must be followed when building loadouts: You must carry at least three (3) Decimators You must carry at least one (1) Jammer Grenade You must be in Agile Armor Three Decimators give you a total of nine shots. Typical Gunner Variant BFRs take 4-5 decimator shots. This is assuming you hit the armor with every shot. While this only requires 2 decimators, the third one is needed for the deci-swap technique itself (plus it's insurance for those of us with either bad aim or lousy pings). The one jammer grenade is needed to slow a BFR to a speed in which it can be engaged, as well as disable a few systems, rendering it an easy target. Agile armor is required due to the fact that you cannot pilot an aircraft in Rexo , and the inventory space of both the Infiltrator and Standard Armor is insufficient to carry your payload.","title":"Required Items"},{"location":"NeoPhoenixTR/#the-poor-mans-loadout","text":"![Image:BFRHunter-MALoadout.gif](BFRHunter-MALoadout.md.gif \"fig:Image:BFRHunter-MALoadout.gif\") Example of a \"Poor Man's Loadout\" The first loadout described is for those who don't have the certs for [Heavy Assault](Heavy_Assault.md). This is good for characters who are at very low [Battle Ranks](Battle_Rank.md) that need to make some quick [BEP](Battle_Experience_Points.md) by hunting. The loadout to the left satisfies the minimum conditions with the 3 Decimators, and the Jammer. Also, note that the first Decimator is in the active rifle (or number 2) holster. The [Sweeper Shotgun](Sweeper.md) is a good choice for a defensive weapon from the [Medium Assault](Medium_Assault.md) pool. It specializes in close-combat, and is common-pool, so the price is right. The [REK](Remote_Electronics_Kit.md) is totally optional. It's recommended if you have [Advanced Hacking](Advanced_Hacking.md), and it's also a good idea to keep a REK on you at all times anyways. ;) **WARNING!** _Make sure your defensive weapon is loaded with standard (white) ammo! AP (gold) ammo wont help you here!_ An important thing to note in this loadout is the spacing indicated in the picture by the yellow box. Make sure you leave that spacing there, meaning putting your gun all the way on the left side of the inventory backpack. The reasoning behind this space is simple. When you swap your defensive weapon (the Sweeper in this case) into your active rifle holster, you wont drop the Decimator that was in your active holster while in combat. Resist that urge to put a second jammer, pistol-sized item, or even box of ammo in there. That jammer, pistol, or ammo could cost you the kill later on.","title":"The Poor Man's Loadout"},{"location":"NeoPhoenixTR/#the-optimal-loadout","text":"![Image:BFRHunter-HALoadout.gif](BFRHunter-HALoadout.md.gif \"fig:Image:BFRHunter-HALoadout.gif\") Example of an Optimal BFR Hunter Loadout The second loadout described is for those who have advanced a few Battle Ranks and can afford the big guns. This is the loadout I personally use when BFR hunting. Since we're now using Heavy Assault weapons, the common-pool weaponry is out the window. This is where problems can occur between empires. Given the empire-specific weapons, the [TR](Terran_Republic.md) and the [NC](New_Conglomerate.md) have the best defensive HA weapons, while the [VS](Vanu_Sovereignty.md) are at a disadvantage. The TR's [Mini-Chaingun](Mini-Chaingun.md) has a 100 bullet clip that is capable of killing 2-3 grunts before running dry. The NC's [Jackhammer](Jackhammer.md) is like the Sweeper, but bigger, specializing in close-combat. The VS' [Lasher](Lasher.md), however, only has 25 shots, and is at a disadvantage outdoors, where any BFR takedown will be taking place. My recommendation is that any VS BFR Hunter stick to the Sweeper used in the \"Poor Man's Loadout\" described earlier. **WARNING!** _Make sure your defensive weapon is loaded with standard (white) ammo! AP (gold) ammo wont help you here!_ (yes, second time, it's _that_ important) Something noted in the last section, the Decimator in the active rifle holster by defeault, is also present in this loadout. The reasoning behind this is that you need to be firing a Decimator first when you land on your target. This placement saves time and effort later on from not having to swap out your defensive weapon for a Decimator. This makes more sense in the next section.","title":"The Optimal Loadout"},{"location":"NeoPhoenixTR/#the-technique-itself","text":"Enough about how to setup your loadouts.

Having your cursor in this postion before opening your inventory will allow you to do this. Before challenging a BFR, open your inventory, and place your cursor on one of the other Decimators like the one in the picture is. Then close your inventory. Next time you open your invetory window, your mouse cursor will still be there. **WARNING!** _Going into your map between setting your cursor and opening it again for the Deci-Swap will reset the cursor's postion to center!_ This is where being nervous and/or obsessive compulsive can save your butt!

Did I mention the entire cycle should take no more than 3 seconds? Yeah, my hand's cramping too. During this process, during one of your swaps (the 3rd or 4th shot at latest), you need to move your mouse cursor (as shown in the picture) to the \"third deci\" to swap in. The reasoning behind this (and why you even brought that third Decimator) is that you need to keep firing off Decimators at this accelerated rate. If you keep swapping the same two Decimators, they will both run out, and you'll be stuck firing that third one at \"normal\" speeds (which you may as well just point at the ground cause you are likely screwed by now). Swap the third one in to simply delay the ammo running dry on the other two so you always have two Decimators to fire.","title":"Fire-Swap-Pull-Fire"},{"location":"NeoPhoenixTR/#practicing","text":"Chances are you're still reading the last section, especially the part about doing all that within 3 seconds per cycle.

Good \"Game trail\" examples include: Bridges (especally the Ceryshen bridge between Sedna and Anguta) Roads Direct land routes between two bases Areas between towers and their respective base But, these aren't the only places. This is where use of \"The Force\" may be needed. You need to be able to \"feel out\" your enemy. Quite literally asking \"If I were a BFR pilot looking for kills, where would I go and how would I get there?\" It may be common sense, but, alot of people tend to look for BFRs just at towers and bases.

These variants have alot of armor, but can't outrun infantry while jammed. Picking on the sick and wounded would mean finding a damaged BFR, and finishing it off. This would require use of the Enhanced Targeting implant to spot low health bars, or just a keen sense of how hurt a BFR is simply by how it moves. If a BFR is running away from a target, good chance that it's probably hurt, or at least in no shape to attack. This also applies to enemy frames that are under attack by friendly forces. I myself tend to drop in on a BFR being targetting by my own empire, seeking both the kill and the glorious cheers from teammates. (Some actually calling it a \"priviledge to watch the legend at work!\" Do KingAildiyan and Ash go through this? seriously) Picking on the ignorant, despite how cruel it may seem, is just as effective. If you see a BFR that's doing something that makes it an easy target (such as a flight variant crouching while camping or a gunner variant camping against a wall), attack it!

Niven's Notes: Striker (See also: Striker ) The Striker has perhaps the most flexibilty of the four infantry-based AV weapon systems, equally able to tackle MAX, Ground and Air targets. Some notes to help use it: Not Fire and Forget : A common misconception among NC and VS troops is the Striker is point and click. While the tracking system does mean the rocket will home in on the target, the target must be kept in the reticule to guide the rocket all the way in, to be sure of a hit. The nearest equivalent is the Starfire MAX weapon system. Range : The Stiker will not lock on to targets more than 250m away. Also, the rocket itself, if Dumbfired, will tend to timeout (explode) at this distance anyway. Do not waste rockets on Liberators at the flight ceiling, you will not hit, unless at a very high altitude base ( Searhus Crater, Ceryshen Mesas). Reloads : Most AV targets will require at least one full clip (5) of rockets, meaning that anything larger that a MAX unit will need a reload to kill, dangerously increasing the TTK required. Try to plan accordingly, and always reload after each salvo; don't holster a half-full Striker. Outdoor Only : While the Striker can be used indoors, as a general rule the Decimator is a better choice for close-quarter battles against MAX units and Spawn/Generator destruction. The Decimator does much more damage per shot, and you are unlikely to survive for more than two shots in front of an AI MAX. Change loadout before going inside, if possible. Not AI : The Striker can kill non-MAX Infantry eventually, but not before they kill you with almost any MA/HA/SA weapon. A Striker is best used with a second choice of weapon; even pistols or handheld grenades provide better Anti-Infantry effectiveness. Best Used In Packs : Realistically, the lone Striker user can only expect to solo-kill MAX, Air Cavalry, ATV and Lightning Vehicles. Larger units may be driven off, but are equally likely to take the hits and return fire, and even deployed AMS can present problems due to spawning. In packs however, the Striker can dominate outdoor battle areas; 2+ Strikers will threaten Medium Battle Tanks, and 5+ will drive off or destory BFRs. Co-ordination is the key though; if you have a Striker and see another Striker user firing, find his target and help him out. There is no 'kill-stealing' in Planetside and alone, neither of you are likely to get the kill. Kills in this manner tend to average out, as it is largely random who gets the last rocket in. Use From Cover : Striker users are quickly singled out by tank gunners and Air Cav pilots, so make sure you have something solid to hide behind; trees, rocks, base walls and doors. Have an escape route ready if you can. Where possible, watch the vehicle for a few seconds before opening fire. Choosing a moment when the vehicle is busy elsewhere before firing can greatly improve chances of survival and a kill. Once the vehicle knows where you are, you typically have seconds (One clip; 5 shots) to either destroy it or force it to flee, before being killed. Having the Striker set to Dumbfire until you're ready to open fire can increase the element of suprise further, by preventing the tell-tale 'Missile Lock' warning until you're ready to actually fire. Run And Gun : The Striker has no appreciable Cone of Fire bloom, and can be used just as effectively while running and strafing, as crouching, so if you have been spotted, you can make it more difficult for them to return fire. If you drive a vehicle off, but fail to kill it, relocate to a new position as soon as is practical; he knows where you are, knows you are a threat and will probably be back from an different direction. This is demonstrated by the 'Reaver Rocketspam Foxtrot', whereby the Striker user runs toward, then under the craft, firing all the while, thereby dodging the worst of the hits. This works more times than you might think. Inventory Management : Striker ammo boxes are 4x4 in size, so present difficulties in inventory management. However, it is unlikey any Striker user will need to carry more than three boxes (45 shots, 9 reloads) in Rexo. You'll either be dead before they are all used, or near enough a base, tower or AMS during that time, to resupply. Often two boxes is enough, allowing room for secondary weapon ammo, and support items. (This holds true for Lancer and Phoenix users too.) Useful When Empty : Unlike the other AV weapons, the Striker remains useful even when exhausted. Any vehicle being locked by the Striker recieves a big red 'Missle Lock' warning indicator, with alarming noises. This is effective in scaring away Air Cavalry and Light Ground units in many cases, even if no rockets are launched. CE Clearance : The Striker will lock on and destroy Spitfire Turrets in one shot, and in Secondary (Dumbfire) mode can safely destory mines, boomers and motion sensors, in one shot each. The Striker is suitable for destroying Phalanx turrets from a safe range as well. Useful if EMP is unavailable. Other Gear : Striker users will need a backup weapon for Anti-Infantry work; the Medium Assault Category is ideal for this, in particular the Punisher (EMP), and the Sweeper . Engineering ( BANK ) will be useful to patch up splash damage and rocket spam, as the Striker tends to attract a lot of this. Combat Engineering compliments AV well, creating a well-rounded Anti Vehicle Specialist. Special Assault provides access to the EMP loaded Thumper , which can disrupt vehicle guns, prior to oppening fire with the Striker. At a pinch, handheld Jammer grenades can help, but require far more practice to land well. Enhanced Targeting is the single most useful implant for a dedicated Striker user, allowing progress to be measured and weaker vehicles to be picked off. Personal Shield can provide a few extra crucial seconds to get the last rockets in, and Surge can help the AV trooper to get to cover if it goes wrong. Reinforced Exo-Suit allows a much needed back-up rifle slot, and greater survivability outdoors. Don't Give Up! : AV weapons do not generally yield the same sheer quantity of kills and xp as HA, and you are basically getting in the way of tanks, on foot, so you will die lots. However the AV cert makes up for it in quality of kills, and getting that last rocket in on an enemy BFR can be an immensely satisfying experience. Regardless, AV does help your Empire, and the more people that carry it, the more powerful it becomes. And remember, even just driving the tank away to repair is still a victory, as that is time he is not spending farming your grunts. Countering The Striker: Location : The key to dealing with the Striker, is know where it is. Head to head, from a standing start, in an open field, the Striker user will lose to just about everything but MAX units, and even that might be touch and go. The Striker relies on suprise, and the inital confusion before his position is revealed, to cause signficant damage. Once he is spotted, the fight turns against him very quickly, but by this point, sufficient damage may have been caused to make it academic. Approach the combat area slowly and only charge once a Striker position has been confirmed. Air Cavalry should always try to have a full tank of Afterburner ready, as this will allow the fragile Mosquito and Reaver to outrun Striker missiles to safety. Less disciplined Striker users will tend to fire at anything and everything as soon as it comes into range, and this can pinpoint them quickly to the patient and observant. Striker rockets in flight show as red dashes on the proximity map, giving further clues. Line of Sight : The Striker actually locks to a very small point in the centre of the vehicle. This means an object as narrow as a single tree can cause the lock to be lost. If under fire, with no immediate opportunity to kill the Striker user, head for trees, low hills, rocks, buildings, even other friendly vehicles, and get them between you and the Striker. Reaquisition of lock takes a second or so, so a vehicle going full-tilt through a forest becomes virtually impossible to track. Avoid Dense Troops : Around 20% of all TR troops have AV certified, so a fair assumption would be that every fifth TR grunt outdoors is carrying a Striker, and many others will be carrying some form of EMP. Charging into a dense pack of such troops is asking for trouble, especially by air, or in slow ground vehicles. Instead, work at the edges and hit and fade. Locate and pick off lone Striker users that stray from the herd too much; most vehicles stand a reasonable chance against a single Striker. Infiltrate : Striker users generally tend to focus on the sky and horizon, and so can be more vulnerable than most troops to cloaker attack via AMP, Boomer or Knife. Time the attack with their own, as the noise from the Striker will mask any noises your initial attack may make. Range : As noted above; vehicles are safe beyond 250m. Many vehicle guns are capable of longer ranges, particularly arcing projectiles, such as the Vanguard main gun. Use these to retaliate in saftey. Send In The Grunts : With the Striker occupying one rifle slot and a backpack full of very big boxes, even Rexo Striker users are already at a disadvantage against dedicated HA/SA infantry. Send squadmates or outfit members in to help distract and flush the Striker's position. Run MAX, Run : In most cases, the MAX is likely to lose against the Striker, given enough distance, and suprise. The best defence for the MAX is cover; if in run-mode, stay in run-mode. You aren't any more difficult to track, but may be able to make it to trees or cover faster. Walking MAX should try to return fire if within range, particularly AI MAX, but are likely to be killed first unless within 20-30m or so. NC MAX can use the shield to buy more time to reach cover, but in most cases for VS MAX, using the jumpjet is exactly the wrong thing to do. Stay on the ground, and seek cover, as you are much easier to hit in mid-air. Angle of Attack : Particularly useful for Air Cavalry, if the location of the Striker is known (above), the best way to elimiate him is by aproaching low from an unexpected direction, ideally over a ridgetop, away from the main battle area, and cutting them down from behind. The machine guns, used from range, work best as there is less tell-tale engine or rocket launch sounds to give the game away. Category:Strategy","title":"Niven's Notes"},{"location":"Niven%27s_Notes/#nivens-notes-striker","text":"(See also: Striker ) The Striker has perhaps the most flexibilty of the four infantry-based AV weapon systems, equally able to tackle MAX, Ground and Air targets. Some notes to help use it: Not Fire and Forget : A common misconception among NC and VS troops is the Striker is point and click. While the tracking system does mean the rocket will home in on the target, the target must be kept in the reticule to guide the rocket all the way in, to be sure of a hit. The nearest equivalent is the Starfire MAX weapon system. Range : The Stiker will not lock on to targets more than 250m away. Also, the rocket itself, if Dumbfired, will tend to timeout (explode) at this distance anyway. Do not waste rockets on Liberators at the flight ceiling, you will not hit, unless at a very high altitude base ( Searhus Crater, Ceryshen Mesas). Reloads : Most AV targets will require at least one full clip (5) of rockets, meaning that anything larger that a MAX unit will need a reload to kill, dangerously increasing the TTK required. Try to plan accordingly, and always reload after each salvo; don't holster a half-full Striker. Outdoor Only : While the Striker can be used indoors, as a general rule the Decimator is a better choice for close-quarter battles against MAX units and Spawn/Generator destruction. The Decimator does much more damage per shot, and you are unlikely to survive for more than two shots in front of an AI MAX. Change loadout before going inside, if possible. Not AI : The Striker can kill non-MAX Infantry eventually, but not before they kill you with almost any MA/HA/SA weapon. A Striker is best used with a second choice of weapon; even pistols or handheld grenades provide better Anti-Infantry effectiveness. Best Used In Packs : Realistically, the lone Striker user can only expect to solo-kill MAX, Air Cavalry, ATV and Lightning Vehicles. Larger units may be driven off, but are equally likely to take the hits and return fire, and even deployed AMS can present problems due to spawning. In packs however, the Striker can dominate outdoor battle areas; 2+ Strikers will threaten Medium Battle Tanks, and 5+ will drive off or destory BFRs. Co-ordination is the key though; if you have a Striker and see another Striker user firing, find his target and help him out. There is no 'kill-stealing' in Planetside and alone, neither of you are likely to get the kill. Kills in this manner tend to average out, as it is largely random who gets the last rocket in. Use From Cover : Striker users are quickly singled out by tank gunners and Air Cav pilots, so make sure you have something solid to hide behind; trees, rocks, base walls and doors. Have an escape route ready if you can. Where possible, watch the vehicle for a few seconds before opening fire. Choosing a moment when the vehicle is busy elsewhere before firing can greatly improve chances of survival and a kill. Once the vehicle knows where you are, you typically have seconds (One clip; 5 shots) to either destroy it or force it to flee, before being killed. Having the Striker set to Dumbfire until you're ready to open fire can increase the element of suprise further, by preventing the tell-tale 'Missile Lock' warning until you're ready to actually fire. Run And Gun : The Striker has no appreciable Cone of Fire bloom, and can be used just as effectively while running and strafing, as crouching, so if you have been spotted, you can make it more difficult for them to return fire. If you drive a vehicle off, but fail to kill it, relocate to a new position as soon as is practical; he knows where you are, knows you are a threat and will probably be back from an different direction.

All three Empires have their own variant of the OMFT, the New Conglomerate has the Osprey , the Terran Republic has the Avenger and the Vanu Sovereignty has the Orion . The OMFTs have weaponry similar to that of the Anti-Infantry MAX of each Empire. These Turrets have Shield Generation, that increases when deployed, which is similar to the Shields that vehicles have, though enemy players with Enhanced Targeting can see the shield strength. The turrets have an unlimited ammunition supply reserve. Simply reload as often as you like to keep your active magazine filled with ammunition. Be aware when operating one of these Turrets, for they can be jacked , while you're in it by only an advanced hacker . If jacked by an advanced hacker, the turret will deconstruct. However, if an Expert Hacker jacks the turret, it will remain in the game world and will be usable by the enemy. OMFT cannot be placed inside a friendly or enemy Sphere of Influence or on bridges, but can be placed within the SOI of a neutral base. A maximum of 5 can be placed by an engineer at a time and share interferece ranges with AMSes , TRAPs , and Aegis Shield Generators . If left unmanned, they will deconstruct automatically in about 5 minutes.

This is great first step to getting this project off of the ground. PSForever goal is to reproduce PlanetSide 1 server functionality in order to preserve its one-of-a-kind gameplay, forever. Many of us have fond memories of playing PS with friends and it's quite sad to see PS in its current state: frozen, overrun with hackers, and with no steady population. It's strange how a game can evoke such nostalgia and emotion, but there it is. Everyone has a PlanetSide story to tell. PlanetSide 2 was supposed to be the \"NextGen\" version of PlanetSide 1, but its clunky gameplay mechanics just don't compare to PS1. While PS2 looks better, PS1's gameplay is truly unique. It's not Yet-Another-Run-and-Gun game. It has real strategy, progression, and teamwork. This isn't to say PS1 was the \"best game ever\"...It wasn't. But it was a unique, quirky, and overall great time. This is what we remember about PS1. PS1 was revolutionary for it's time as a new genre and with a single persistent world where decisions and base captures really do matter. The current state of the project is focused on capturing existing PlanetSide functionality through the use of a packet logger. In the event of a server outage, any capture files, screenshots, databases, etc. will be crucial in order to reproduce vanilla PS (minus the terrible parts). This along with static analysis of the PS binaries will allow us to make a PlanetSide private server, using a process similar to TrinityCore, MaNGOS, EVEmu, ShadowbaneEmu, SWGEmu, and many more inspiring projects. Even if you aren't a die hard PlanetSide fan, that's okay. This project is for everyone interested in helping preserve a little slice of history from the digital garbage bin. Current there is only one developer working on this project, i.e. me. My schedule is quite busy beyond this project, but with regular updates and your support, this project will come to fruition. Check back regularly for new project updates, tool releases, and ideas. In the mean time, register an account to get involved. Also, start capturing packets in order to record PlanetSide gameplay! If you have already started capturing, hold on to those captures. I'll be making a form to submit them when I get the chance.

The second is by upgrades made by Expert Hackers using their REK to hack a facility's Matrix Panel and/or Generator Terminal .

While there is always a Pain Field in the Respawn room when the generator is online, the pain module increases its lethality. Cavern spawn rooms deal Pain Module damage by default. The pain module is useful for base defense and to protect other modules installed at the base. When combined with the boosted pain fields from expert hackers (increasing the damage done to 15 damage per second), it is very difficult to destroy the generator, and thus difficult for the enemy to steal modules.

Gunner variants have, in addition to the pilot weapons, an extra gunner pod on their backs which can be manned by a second soldier. They also have more armor and a faster shield regeneration rate than their flight counterparts, which gives them greater \"staying power.\" In the gunner variant, the shields will be activated whenever a soldier enters either the pilot or gunner's seat, and will remain active as long as someone occupies one of these positions.

Its effect is simple: It allows you to use your stamina to absorb damage taken at a 1 to 1 ratio. This, essentially, gives you 100 more armor, enough to take an extra sniper bullet or survive that extra second you need to kill an enemy before he kills you. Unfortunately, Personal Shield (or P-Shield, or PS for short) has a tendency to run you completely out of stamina, forcing you to walk and disabling all your implants until you regenerate 20 stamina.

Category:Terminology Category:Game Guides","title":"Personal Waypoint"},{"location":"Phalanx/","text":"]] Phalanx wall turrets are the only fixed weapons and non-passive defensive installations of surface bases and gun and air towers . When unmanned, the Phalanx can track and fire upon larger vehicles and aircraft, as well as MAX units (only if they are in run mode). ATVs , Harassers , and Mosquitos are invisible to Phalanx turrets. An active unmanned Phalanx will return fire if fired upon and is less than 50% damaged. It is extremely accurate when unmanned, but its rate of fire is about one-third of it is when manned. When manned, the Phalanx offers a very high rate of fire, unlimited ammunition, 360\u00b0 rotation, a range of 400m, and a fairly high firing angle which allows it to target aircraft. Unfortunately, it has a large cone of fire , making it inaccurate at long ranges. It can also be destroyed easily, taking only a few tank rounds to make it inoperable. When a Phalanx turret is completely destroyed, it becomes unusable. It can be returned to working order again by repairing it to 50% of its health using a Nano Dispenser . The Phalanx will be automatically repaired, albeit very slowly, as long as the base has a supply of NTUs. Without any assistance from soldiers, a completely destroyed Phalanx takes approximately 50 minutes to self-repair to a usable state (therefore, an unattended Phalanx will completely repair itself in about 1 hour and 40 minutes). The Phalanx can be upgraded by soldiers having the Fortification Engineering certification to fire either Anti-Aircraft or Anti-Armor rounds in addition to the standard rounds. The Anti-Aircraft Flak Cannon rounds are similar to the flak rounds of the skyguard , but fires at a slightly slower rate. The Anti-Armor Twin-Cannons rounds are similar to the rate of fire and trajectory of the prowler main gun, but the damage is not as great. Kills made with the flak cannon also count towards the Air Defender merit . Upgrades are done with the Nano Dispenser and last for 30 minutes unless destroyed or the base changes empire control. The type of upgrade can be changed at any time by starting the process over again. When firing in auto-fire mode, upgraded turrets only fire standard rounds. Soldiers certed in Data Corruption can infect enemy Wall Turrets causing them to fire at their own Empire, instead of their enemies. However, they will act as regular Wall Turrets when infected, meaning they will only shoot vehicles and auto-running MAX Units.

It can carry 4 passengers and can be cloaked by the pilot by pressing the \"B\" key by default. Traveling at speeds greater than 40 km/h (between 20% and 30% throttle) will make the vehicle slightly visible (note that at 30% throttle (42 km/h) you will appear cloaked on your screen but others will see a slight outline). Strafing, rising, or descending while traveling over 14 km/h will also expose the aircraft. Traveling at speeds above 50% throttle will create visible contrails on the wings of aircraft and enemies can easily see it at great distances. Note that there is a bug where sometimes enemies can see the phantasm's opacity as if it were traveling at 100% throttle even if it is nearly stationary. This is annoying as not all enemies are affected, but if one sees you and starts shooting, many others follow. One tactic to combat this bug, if you notice enemies at great distance shooting your stationary phantasm, is to descend so that your landing struts extend. This sometimes fixes the bug. If that doesn't work, you need to fly past the drawing distance of the enemies, get out of the vehicle, then get in again. The Phantasm has the greatest sustainable speed of any aircraft in the game. Over reasonable distances, it is the only aircraft other than the Wasp that can outrun a Mosquito if the afterburner is applied optimally. The trade-off is that the Phantasm has very poor acceleration and deceleration, thus changes in speed must be planned well in advance (especially when preparing to land). Lock-on weapons are ineffective against the Phantasm while cloaked, though Flak will still explode in proximity to it. Automated defense systems will not fire on a cloaked phantasm. An enemy cloaked phantasm inside the SOI of a base with interlink benefits will show up on the proximity map of friendly players. The pilot can wear up to Agile Exo-Suit armor, and can earn the Galaxy Support Pilot merit for kills made by players after they bail from the aircraft.

The warhead can be manually detonated at any time in the flight path by pressing the fire key a second time. The rocket is cumbersome to steer and has a limited range, usually requiring the operator to fire in the general direction of his target in order to ascertain he will be able to adjust the rocket's flightpath in time for impact. Also, the weapon cannot be reloaded while a rocket is being camera guided. The operator is unaware of his surroundings while piloting the Phoenix , making him susceptible to nearby enemy troops.

The game was first released on May 20th, 2003, and has undergone numerous updates since then, including Core Combat and The Bending . PlanetSide received an ESRB rating of Teen. The game is purely a multiplayer affair, and has only been released for the Windows Operating System. Story After traveling through a womrhole, the Terran Republic , a highly centralized galactic government which has ruled humans for the past 1,112 years, discovered the planet of Auraxis . Several expeditions were sent through the wormhole to colonize Auraxis, and soon after the colonists discovered the remains of an ancient alien race, the Vanu. This allowed for the rapid colonization of the ten continents of Auraxis, as well as development of new technologies, most importantly - rebirthing technology. Rebirthing technology allowed humans to deconstruct and reconstruct their bodies, but more importantly, workers who had lost their lives could be brought back to life using rebirthing technology. However, the colony was soon cut off as the wormhole collapsed, and dissension brewed within the ranks within the Republic. A loss of faith in the Terran Republic caused the colonists to split into three very distinct factions and a war over technology began. Terran Republic The Terran Republic consists of colonists who remained loyal to the Republic, and is a conservative, authoritarian collectivist nation with the goal of re-establishing contact with the homeworld and re-unite the warring factions. Thier leadership comes in the form of a public oligarchy known as the Overwatch, composed of various representive officials and thier ministries, who regulate their parts of society with their own expertise and the collective will create favorable outcomes. The Republic feels that authority is the bastion that protects humanity. They feel that in a free society, with no Big Brother figure, misery and suffering will be quickly visited to all. The Republic regards the Vanu technology as dangerous and volatile force which threatens the stability of their order, and only use it in warfare begrudingly. The Republic view of the future is one of peace through their benevolent rule, and a reunited colony through the reopening of the wormhole. The Republic stands by the view that the Vanu were extinct by their meddling with orders of power and fear that using this technology again will drive humanity into a similar fate, causing as much damage to reality along the way. The Republic relies on the brute strength of their armies and fleets, and the application of their superior firepower. New Conglomerate The New Conglomerate is a militant seperatist faction composed of anarchists, liberals, and libertarians determined to break and remain free from the domineering Republic. They seek to liberate all of humanity from the Republic, regardless of whether or not they share the Conglomerate's view. As a group of rebels, their leadership lies within the Revolutionary Command, a visible group of military experts who guide the liberation efforts as a whole. They feel that any type of control is oppression, and would rather be a miserable free man than a contented slave. They view Vanu technology as a tool of control, and that the Sovereignty are simply technochratic tyrants, would-be dictators under the banner of science, and just as bad as the Republic, if not worse. Their ideal view of the future is one of freedom and self-government, where each man flourishes in his own way as he sees fit. The Conglomerate relies on their strength in numbers and their ability to strike fast with light vehicles and infantry. Vanu Sovereignty The Vanu Sovereignty is a loose transhumanist cult of academics, intellectuals, and technology worshippers who believe that the future of humanity lies within the exploitation of alien technology. Their leadership is the Sovereignty Council, whose composition is unknown to even the members of the Sovereignty and is completely obscured to non-members of the Sovereignty. They see the Republic as an outmoded restriction on the continued development of alien technology and cotinued development of the species through synthesis of man and machine. They also see the Conglomerate as a savage band of thugs, possessed by a mob rule and refuse to see that technology is the future of humanity. The ideal Sovereignty future is one of scientific purity and perfection, and believe that the Vanu race used the power of their advanced sciences to transcend their corporeal limitations and the mundane world, ascending to a superior state of being, and, ultimately, a higher plane of existance. They envision humanity following a similar path, first through the enhancement of humans through science, and, ultimately, the replacement of humans by machines. The Sovereignty is the most reliant on alien technology, and often use it to overcome their shortcomings through the superiority of their engineering, utilizing mind bending physics and high-energy arrays to defend themselves. Analysis Within the game, there has been much discussion over which factions are inherently good or evil . Some claim the Republic to be the empire that was intended to be the villains of the game, due to the theoretical similarity to Fascism , although it can be argued that neither the Republic nor Fascism are inherently bad, as they are only doing what they feel is right on the whole, which is protecting humanity from its own incompetence. These same people also tend to contest that the New Conglomerate are the heroes of the game, however, this is also contestable. The New Conglomerate is rabidly anti-everyone and see no room for beliefs other than their own, and also because of the fact that, living in a Liberal Democracy, one might be pre-inclined to see liberty as the cheif concern. Most people agree that the Sovereignty are at least partial villains, due to their embrace of technologies today we say as immoral, and due to their notion of replacing humans with machines. However, this may also be contested as our understanding of such technology such as cloning and genetic engineering stem from the latest science fiction film. Ultimately, it seems as though the developers of PlanetSide were attempting to make each of the factions good in someways, but none of them have are morally better than the other, and all of them have some sort of moral bankruptcy within their backstories. Also, each of the empires are far too fanatical one-sided about their own views to be taken seriously as a point. Gameplay At any one time in the game, thousands of soldiers can be fighting across many different types of environments in many different types of vehicles or on foot. PlanetSide is one of the first first person shooters with a persistent war, with one simple goal in mind of all of the players: gain more land while denying the other two factions from gaining land. There are many opportunities within PlanetSide to use tactics, but learning the intricacies and depth of battles can take many months. PlanetSide does not suffer from the 'hands-off' feel of many other Massively Multiplayer Online Games. Leveling and Experience Although PlanetSide is a first person shooter at heart, it does have a levelling system. Players can gain Battle Experience Points to gain Battle Ranks which can be used to get certifications , implants , and uniform upgrades . Also, through leading, a player can gain Command Experience Points to gain Command Ranks , which give the players different command related abilities. Updates The game is still being actively supported by Sony Online Entertainment , with a patch being released about once a month. These patches usually focus on fixing in-game bugs and adding new content. PlanetSide also has a Test Server like other online games to test changes before they go onto live servers. box art.]] Core Combat On October 27, 2003, PlanetSide's first expansion pack, Core Combat was released. This expansion pack added new areas and new weapons for players. Story A new area underneath several continents was discovered. These caverns appear to be the remnants of the ancient Vanu civilization. Geowarps on six continents, Hossin , Amerish , Ceryshen , Oshur , Solsar and Forseral , were discovered that led to caverns underneath these continents. These caverns reflected the continent above, but no colonist from the Republic had ever seen them before. The Geowarps appeared from thin air, and were not there when the Republic originally surveyed the surface of these continents, and there were no reports of anyone building these Geowarps. Sovereignty scientists speculate that these caverns were used by the Ancients as a staging house for energies that swept over the entire planet. Also, these underground chambers were not for habitation, but were merely baffles and routing structures for these energies. However, due to an information leak within the Sovereignty scientists, the other two empires also know how to activate the Geowarps and how to take advantage of the information inside of the caverns. Because of this, the three empires are using these new areas to produce new technologies for war, but because all three empires have access to the Geowarps, no empire has a technological advantage. However, these new technologies could change the face of the battlefield. Changes to Caverns With more recent patches , the way the caverns work has changed. Rather than having the six caverns being linked to the same six continents all the time, two caverns are open at any time and are linked to random continents on the surface, and the other four caverns have a countdown timer to when they will be opened. Ancient Modules With these caverns came the addition of modules . These are powerful tools, which, when installed in a surface facility , grant that facility and all other friendly facilities in the lattice certain benefits. The six types of modules are equipment , health , pain , shield , speed , and vehicle . Criticism Many users criticize Core Combat as an expansion pack, as they feel the content added was not enough to justify its purchase. They feel that the new equipment and vehicles added in Core Combat aren't accessible enough, as it can be fairly difficult to acquire this Ancient Technology equipment. Also, many people state that fights in the caverns do not happen often enough to justify a purchase of Core Combat. The Bending On August 14, 2004, the planet Auraxis underwent a change. For a few days before this happened, the planet had been undergoing constant meteor showers. No one knew what these meant, but people kept fighting on. Right before it happened, the meteor showers became heavier, and then, right before it happened, you could hear the words \"Bending Sequence Initiated\". Everyone was forced to respawn back at their sanctuary. Everything looked the same, but soldiers noted the different stars. Each of the continents was pushed off of Auraxis and became a smaller planet on their own. The warpgates still funcioned under the normal lattice , but the skies were different. Also, Oshur was removed completely, and in its place were the Battle Islands . box art.]] Aftershock Aftershock was released on October 18th, 2004. While some people refer to Aftershock as a second expansion, Aftershock is simply a repackaging of the original PlanetSide along with Core Combat . However, Aftershock marked the introduction of a new gameplay element, BattleFrame Robotics (BFR's).

Because of this, the three empires are using these new areas to produce new technologies for war, but because all three empires have access to the Geowarps, no empire has a technological advantage. However, these new technologies could change the face of the battlefield.","title":"Story"},{"location":"PlanetSide/#changes-to-caverns","text":"With more recent patches , the way the caverns work has changed.

Right before it happened, the meteor showers became heavier, and then, right before it happened, you could hear the words \"Bending Sequence Initiated\". Everyone was forced to respawn back at their sanctuary. Everything looked the same, but soldiers noted the different stars.

Whether you've purchased, installed, and patched PlanetSide or are just sitting on the john, this guide will help you gain an understanding of the Planetside game mechanics, earn you a couple of battle ranks, and get you in the game as fast as possible. When you log on for the first time, you will be asked what server you wish to use. The geographically closest one will most likely have the best performance; it would be an idea to start there. Currently in beta there is limited choice so just pick one that's up and running. Character Creation Choose Your EmpireAfter logging in, it will be time to choose your empire. You are allowed 4 characters from only one empire per server. Each empire has a different flavor which you can read about The fast explanation is that the Terran Republic (red and black) are based on heavy armor. The Vanu Sovereignty (purple) are alien technology based. The New Conglomerate (blue and yellow) are based on heavy weapons. Click on one of the empires, then click next in the lower right hand corner. This next screen is the character control screen. This is where you choose which player you wish to play, delete old characters, and create new ones. Click on \"Create New Character\" on one of the four boxes on the left. Click Next in the lower right hand corner. The is the character creation screen. In the upper right, you can choose gender. Below that, you can choose a face for you character. In the lower right, you can choose the type of voice that they will have. Enter a name in the upper left hand and you're all set. Feel free to zoom in and spin him/her around before clicking next in the lower right hand corner. The server will attempt to register the character. If there is a problem with your name according the acceptable use policy of SOE or the name you have chosen has already been taken, then you will be informed. Otherwise, you will return to the character control screen. Now that your character has been created, it's time to get you in game! Take a second to notice the location and rank of your character. Click on your character's name in the box and then click the next button in the lower right. You will move to a new screen where you will be asked where you would like to start. I'm sure you would love to jump right in and do instant action, but you'll get owned pretty quickly with no certifications yet. We'll get to those in a bit. For now, click on the \"Go to Sanctuary\" button and the Play button, lower right. First Steps What you see now is the typical load screen. You will spawn in a respawn tube. Move out of the respawn tube by going forward (default key is 'w') and let's get started. Before I continue, it would be a good idea to familiarize yourself with your keyboard layout. Hit esc and a variety of options will show-up. Hit 'K' for keymapping. Here every possible keymap is available. For those of you who want an inverted mouse, click on the mouse in the upper left. 6 possible boxes including \"invert mouse\" are available. Click esc to close the options window. \"A\" strafes left, \"D\" strafes right., and \"S\" backs you up. Use the mouse to look around. Important: In order to interact with your graphic interface, you must use the mouse arrow. Hitting Tab will allow use of the mouse arrow. You can still move forward, strafe left/right, and backup, but you no longer have mouse look control. The mouse arrow now accesses everything on your interface. To return to mouse-look control, press tab again. As you interact with the world of Auraxis for the first time, text pop-ups will appear. The pop-ups will give you further information about the item you have just seen or used or the action you have just done. If this is your first time playing, it is best if you read all the way through the pop-ups as they have good details and will help you with your adventures. The first one says, \" sanctuary\". You can close the pop-up by pressing esc. Near you will be a waist high terminal with something glowing out of the top. For now, we will skip that. Turn around (mouse movement) and face the tube you just spawned in. If you move forward again, you will receive a pop-up description of the respawn tube. Respawn tubes are all over Auraxis. You can enter the respawn tube and press \"g\" to deconstruct, but we don't want to do that now. There are two doors out of this room. Go out either door. Virtual Reality Training - Weapons The big building outside the door is the HART shuttle building, we will go there later. For now, follow the wall of the building you just came out of. You will see a set of 3 doors. Notice that when you approach the door, it gives the name and distance to object. It should say, \"Training center.\" Go ahead and enter and follow the hallway. You will load a new continent. You will be prompted by 4 options, for now, we want number 1: Shooting Range. You will Load Continent. Here is the virtual reality shooting range. I've been keeping a little secret from you. Each time you try a new event you receive Battle Experience Points (BEPs). This is Sony Online Entertainment's way of saying, \"Hey, there is some important info you need to know, so be sure to check it out.\" While we cruise through this intro guide, you'll be gaining BEPs which is a great thing. Before you go off shooting everything - which we'll do. Press \"I\" to open your inventory. An opaque inventory will show up. Just look for now, we'll be right back. Hit esc to close the box. Press 1 and you're Repeater will come out, walk up to one of the firing lines and empty a clip in something. If you see white crosshairs, you won't hit anything. If you have red crosshairs, you may hit something. If, after pulling the trigger, there is a orange/yellow circle, then you have hit the target. Press 2, your Suppressor will come out, unload a clip. Feel good to shoot something? Good. Hit 'R' for reload. Notice there is a short delay while you reload? In the field you will want to strategically reload whenever you have a chance, nothing worse than having only 2 bullets loaded when you meet the enemy. Now, hit 'X'. This will allow you to switch through the ammo types. You are now loaded up with armor-piercing ammo. It's the yellow ammunition, normal ammo is white. Go ahead and unload the clip. Generally use armor-piercing ammo on Max units and vehicles and standard ammo on infantry. At this time, hit 'I' again and your inventory will open. In your inventory is an REK. Left-click on the REK and put it in the slot 1 where the gun is. See how they hot-swap? You can click on destroy to remove your repeater. Don't worry, guns are \"free\" as long as you have access. More about that later. Press 1 and read about your REK. Keep your inventory open. As you should have read you use the REK to hack locked doors or terminals. Some things can only be hacked with advanced certifications. Remember those waist high terminals we saw when we stepped out of the spawn tube? You should see a number of them in the shooting range room. Walk up to one of those now. Press 'G' to interact with it. Because we are in the Virtual Reality room, you have access to everything. This is not the case in the field so we are going to try everything out. First, click on the armor tab. Currently, you are in standard armor. Lets try on some other armors and see what features they have. Click on agile armor, then in the lower left corner of the equipment screen, click buy. You have now donned agile armor. Click on the infiltration suit and click buy. Notice how the inventory has changed size. Click on reinforced exo suit and buy. Notice how the inventory size changes as well as the number of available weapons. We'll get back to the other armors in a bit. Since we have tried all of these weapons, click on the clear button in the inventory panel. This is used to quickly clear out your inventory. You will be prompted as to whether you want to do this. Click yes, remember, weapons and ammo are free! If the equipment menu is not open, make sure to go back to the terminal and press 'G' again. It should open to the weapons menu. If the menu is open, click on the weapons tab. Let's buy the following guns by clicking on them, then clicking on the buy button: from the pistol menu AMP, from the medium assault your empire specific weapon Cycler (Terran Republic), Lancer (Vanu Sovereignty), or Jackhammer (New Conglomerate), the punisher, the sweeper shotgun, and the bolt-driver. Notice how the AMP automatically fell into slot 1. The Medium Assault weapon fell into slot 3 and the Punisher fell into slot 4. The other 3 weapons were put in inventory. Move on over to the firing line and let's have some fun. Use the AMP in slot 1, the cycler in slot 3 and the punisher in slot 4. You switch by pressing the slot number: 1, 3 or 4. Some weapons have more than one firing method. Press right-click once for each method. The punisher, for example, shoots a rocket. For now, we'll just shoot one clip. Once you have tried each of those guns and the secondary firing systems press 'I' to open the inventory and replace the cycler and punisher with other weapons in the same left-click hot-swap way you did with the REK. Make sure to have some fun with them. Once you have tried all the weapons, clear your inventory and loadup with more weapons. Get the empire specific heavy assault and anti-vehicular, the decimator, thumper, rocklet, and one of each of the 3 grenades. Again, step up to the firing line and try each one out. To gain more distance on a grenade, hold the fire button down longer. After you have tried the 2 grenades and a couple weapons, hot-swap out the other weapons and grenade and keep going. By this time, you should have tried every hand-held weapon your empire offers. If you want to continue to play around with the guns, then have fun. Just come on back to this point in the guide. If you want to learn more about the different weapons you can use in the game at a later point be sure to stop by our weapon list. It's on the left menu or you can click here to read it. Virtual Reality Training - MAX Units Ready to continue? Go back to the terminal and press 'G'. At this point, click on the Armor tab. Those other armors we skipped... well, time to really get crazy. Look down below reinforced exosuit and there are 3 big guns, select the first one. Notice how your inventory has changed. Your hands should have changed too. You are now in a MAX suit. Click \"t\" to see yourself and \"t\" again to return to the terminal. We also need some ammo, click on the ammo box that corresponds to the gun you bought. It's the small box to the right of the gun in the list. Step on over to the firing line and have some fun. Notice how your anti-infantry loadout does little to nothing against other MAX and vehicles. Try each of the MAX loadouts and notice how they do against different targets. You will need to use the 'R' key to reload. Each MAX has a special ability activated with the spacebar. You can learn how these work by checking out our armor information here. Virtual Reality Training - Supply Items Sometime soon you will receive your first battle rank. At this time, press 'O' and your character stats will appear. Look at your experience bar. When you are awarded the next battle rank, open up this screen again and look at it. Return to the terminal. Let's get out of that MAX armor and back into a reinforced exo-suit (under the Armor tab). Clear out the inventory again and then go to the Supply tab. Buy the BANK, Medical applicator and nano-dispenser. Equip each of these and read their pop-ups. Hot swap medical applicator and use it too. You can try these items out on other people in the shooting range. The ACE is a unique item used by combat engineers. It has 4 different modes of operation. Boomers (Manually detonated explosives), Land Mines, Spitfire Gun Turrets and Motion Sensors. Motion sensors are particularly important later in the game as they help a base to use it's automated defenses better (provided your empire owns an Interlink facility). Virtual Reality Training - Vehicles We are done with the Virtual Reality Shoot Range. If you would like to play around some more, feel free. When you are done, step on the green glass to leave. You will be prompted as to where you would like to go. Now, we want number 2. Vehicle Area. You may spawn near an air-terminal or near a vehicle terminal. Either way step on up to the spinning 3 pointed PlanetSide symbol at the terminal. Start at the top and buy each vehicle. If there is any problem, the terminal will prompt you. You can only buy one vehicle at a time. If there is already a vehicle on the pad you need to wait for it to leave before you can purchase a new one. Once the vehicle has spawned move around the driver side door and hop in by pressing 'G'. Some of the tanks and aircraft have a driver's entrance in the front. Feel free to read the pop-up but don't idle too long or the vehicle will deconstruct after a reasonable period of time. Drive the vehicle away from the vehicle pad. Feel free to test drive the vehicle into trees, over hills and through ditches. Park the vehicle by pressing 'S' as a brake. Hop out using \"g\". On the ground will be yellow circles. They designate the positions of the vehicle - driver, gunner, passenger, or trunk. Move to the circles with a gun in a circle (gunner position) and press 'G'. A new pop-up will tell you about this weapon. If a gun has two possible firing option, make sure you right-click to try both option. Do this for every vehicle and every weapon. So as to not make a parking lot of the vehicle area, there is a vehicle control panel button. It is located on a vertical column that is defaulted to appear on the lower right part of your interface. Don't forget you use the tab key to switch your mouse modes to access menus. Click on the car and up will come a \"driver's control\" panel. From here you can lock the car from varying peoples, kick people out, and deconstruct the vehicle. Make sure to deconstruct your vehicle before getting the next one. Once you have tried every air or ground vehicle, it's time to try the other. By hitting 'M' you will pull up a World Map, there is a pop-up for it's description. To add/remove detail to the map, click on the legend in the lower right. To zoom in/out, scroll your mouse. Find a grey square and drive/fly to it. Half the fun is bumping around in the VR getting used to things. The air terminals are about 40 percent bigger than the vehicle terminals. Find the other terminal and try out the other type of vehicles. Once you are finished, you can either hit esc and press \"R\" to recall to sanctuary. The Real World You will spawn back in the respawn tube. That equipment terminal in front of you is still not useful. You're back in the real world now so you only have access to certain things. Exit out one of the doors again, except this time keep running straight ahead to the very tall building. Up top, it will say \"Shuttle\", go in one of the doors. On the ground floor, there are 4 terminals. Walk up to the human-scale with handrails terminal. This is the medical station. These are very useful in the field. Move on over to the implant terminal. It is the one next to the medical station that looks like a giant nutcracker device. Press 'G' and hop in. These are the possible implants. Once you reach battle rank 6 (you should be 2 already!), you receive your first of three implants. Press 'G' to exit. Now let's venture over to the terminal that has the 3 point PlanetSide star floating over it. This should be the certification terminal. Remember when I said you need access to the weapons? Well, this is where you get it. Click on each of the possible certifications in the left panel to check each out or go here to learn more. What do you want to be? How do you want to play? Now is the time to make some decisions. You should have 5 certification points at this time. Before you allocate any cert points, be forewarned you can only \"unlearn\" one certification every 24 hours. If you choose to unlearn a second you will be unable to purchase anything further for 24 hours. When you first start we recommend getting 1 infantry type thing and an Advanced Mobile Station (AMS) certification. This way, you are always right near the action because the AMS system is always popular and allows you to respawn closer to the fights. You should also be able to survive longer because of your infantry cert. As a bonus, you can drive the Advanced Nanite Transport (ANT) which gives you buckets of BEPs when you refill a base. Once you have learned your certifications, move on over to that equipment terminal. Now, make a couple of different load-outs with differing guns, ammo, supplies, and armors. Click on the favorites tab. Click on a blank space, type a name for that loadout, then click save. Next time you interact with an equipment terminal the favorites screen will pop-up first, move your cursor over the screen and press the number you want to use. Double-clicking not necessary. Now, you're ready for action! Squads In order to gain more experience points, focus your attack, and have more fun, I suggest you join a squad. Press tab. Move your cursor over the chat box. There is a LFS tab on the right side of the chat box. Click it. Your name will now have \"[looking for squad]\" underneath it. Press tab to return to mouse look control. If you receive a squad request, there will be a little box in the lower right. Click tab to gain mouse control, then accept by yes, or decline by no, then tab again to return mouse look.

The capture submission has been a great success with 8,801,315 records across 307 capture files submitted so far! If you submitted, thank you so much for your time. If PlanetSide's servers went down today, we'd be in good shape. In other good news, I have just open sourced the GameLauncher and GameLogger tools to GitHub. This means that the GCAP capture files that have been submitted can now be parsed by anyone who wishes it. Also anyone who is enterprising enough can contribute their own changes to the tools (please do). Check out the open source projects now! If you are a C# programmer or someone who wants to learn, have a read through the code. It's not the cleanest, but it should be mostly understandable. From here, the full focus of this project will be getting a minimal login and game server up and running. This is going to be slow at first as there is a lot of boilerplate to be written, such as a PlanetSide compatible networking library. I hope to have some screenshots and things to test within the next couple of months, my schedule permitting. At the moment, I'm not sure if the servers will be open source from the start, or I will open source them when I feel it is appropriate. It's been a good couple of months for the project. We started from nothing and now we're here. The best parts are yet to come. Stick around and enjoy your holidays!

I'm spending a lot of time getting the libraries and base code right as I know it's going to be heavily used. After my work, I now have working packet encryption, decryption, and encryption setup: no small feat. I spent way more time in 2014 than I'd like to admit digging through the horrible ugly crypto + netcode. It paid off though and I now have a clean working crypto library. But the crypto packets are literally just the beginning. There are over 250 more packet types that need reverse engineering. Some technical tangents on the language and architecture: The programming language I chose (Scala) for the server is amazing and expressive. It makes C++ look like assembly language, yet is still very fast. This is good for me and you as I now have to spend a whole lot less time working on the low-level things and I can get straight in to developing Scala has one of the most amazing libraries known as Akka. Akka gives you something called the \"actor model\" in your code. This model allows for dead simple concurrency (many things happening at once), which means the server will be fast. A problem threaded servers have is scheduling work. Each actor can be scheduled individually which will let the server run hot With the actor model, full server crashes are going to be non-existent. Essentially each player session will be given one Actor as a base, so if something crashes, it's likely just to kill that user's session, not the entire server's What this means for you guys is that this server is going to be awesome and modern. It will be able to scale way beyond current planetside servers today.

Apologies for the recent nasty spam attack. I'll be tightening registration and flooding limits to counter act future events. Big thanks to Sulferix and p0intman for keeping things from falling to shit. As for my absence, well I've been working on the server - client communication and I'm able to get an unmodified client to talk to my server and have the client get past the login progress. Yeah not as much as I was hoping for either. I've been quite slammed this spring with work and I just haven't been able to devote as many cycles as I would like. I do need to make a point to keep you guys up to date regardless though. Otherwise I figure most of you will probably scurry off to another corner of the internet out of boredom. I'm currently doing server development on my Linux machine which is great, but obviously not ideal because PlanetSide is windows only. I've been able to get away with this for a while as PlanetSide has great Wine support. The best apart about having chosen Scala is that I don't have to change any code over from Linux to Windows due to it being JVM based. One thing I do have to change which is slowing me down right now is my crypto library is in C++, which is platform specific. It's working for Linux only and I would need to port it over. Not a huge deal, but just something that is bothering me at the moment. In order to speed up development, I have decided to open source what I have so far on the Login Server.

Busy times on my end, but I got to spend some time hacking around with the PlanetSide client tonight. Friday Night Hacking Core combat isn't enabled on the server side, but the PlanetSide client doesn't care! I messed around with map loading state changes and I was able to fake load some cave maps, while being networked on a real continent. To other people it would look quite strange as I would be flying around ignoring any collision detection. Somethings I learned about the game from tonight: All physics and collision detection is clientside. If this were to be removed, then walls, doors, or the floor wouldn't stop you Water damage is server-side Nearly all of the interesting GM commands are patched out of the client. Like the code has literally been compiled out. This is quite sad as I suspect the server probably has more than a fair share of strange bugs regarding these commands. There are multiple embedded command processors within planetside that allows for high level actions to to take place. For example, the command for loading a map is 'psc_loadmap'. This goes for the creation of all game objects as well. Logging the calls to these command processors should help figure out how the game is running The /paintball command is locked behind a special bit on the client, but once enabled it allows the creation of floating text anywhere in the world. It's simply a debug tool and nothing else. The cave maps are located in the PlanetSide/expansion1 folder and are prefixed as ugd. Example: ugd01 When loading in to a cave map while actually running on a bigger continent, the cave map is always towards the bottom left corner of the overworld map. This is where PlanetSide's (0, 0) coordinate lies. There is a /spectator command in the client, but unfortunately it is patched out Here are some screenshots: Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Website News My site is now fully backed up with a disaster recovery plan in place. I can now sleep easy. PSF will never die, NCGauss. Sorry for all of the horrible spam that has cropped up recently. There is a dedicated and passionate group of people who want this project to burn. We should expect more things like this in the future. Active couter-measures are in place and I keep quite a close eye on server health. Login Server Coding Not much has gotten done in this area unfortunately. This is quite important, but the momentum has been lost. Spring break is coming up for me soon and I hope to get some serious coding in then. At least what I have done so far is open source. I need all of the help I can get in this area. Code doesn't write itself. Packet Captures We are nearly at 10 million total packets captured! Holy crap, great work team! PlanetSide Forever Discord If you didn't know, PSF has its own Discord server, courtesy of Naeadil.

Here are some of the things that needed to be completed before this could be done: PlanetSide's cryptographic packets needed to be reverse engineered and the cryptographic setup needed to be figured out.

This was painstaking as PlanetSide's packet format is so compact it's hard to understand Plenty of other reverse engineering to get a real understanding of what the PlanetSide code base was doing (thanks IDA pro) Currently as it stands, the login server is around 2300 lines of dense Scala code.

There are two orientation modes, toggleable via the menu: Map-rotate mode, which will turn the map and always show you facing upwards, and Player-rotate mode, which always shows North upwards and will rotate your arrow to indicate your heading. If you have the Advanced Medical certification and equip the Medical Applicator , fallen soldiers will be shown as glowing triangles. If you are a fallen soldier, friendly Advanced Medics holding Medical Applicators will be shown as glowing crosses (Advanced Medics will see this as well when holding a Medical Applicator). Personal, Squad, and XP Waypoints will show up on your proximity map if they are within display range, or they will indicate the direction to them if they are not. In the upper-left of the pane, small white text indicates your coordinates on the continental map. You can toggle the Map on and off from your Soldier Management Bar, located at the bottom right of your HUD.

The projectiles themselves do no damage, but once they explode they irradiate the immediate area causing damage to all soldiers within the area. There is no protection from this damage, even in a vehicle, except for leaving the irradiated area. However, the damage from the weapon is cut in half if you are in a vehicle or in a MAX suit. In addition to the Special Assault Certification , unless the user is in the core, the base must have an Equipment Module installed for the weapon to be purchased. In primary mode, the projectile will bounce off hard surfaces and will explode when it comes to rest. In secondary mode, the projectile \"sticks\" the the first surface it contacts. When the shell explodes, the effect is radial and can go through any nearby wall. Thus this is an excellent Back Door defense weapon, as it will hurt enemies before they even open the door. While not damaging the shields or armor of BFRs , the radiator can still damage BFR systems such as sensor and aiming systems, as well as reduce the health of the driver/gunner.

To revive a fallen comrade, a player needs the Advanced Medical certification along with a Medical Applicator . Reviving someone takes 25 units of ammo from a Health Canister and takes several seconds. During this period, the Medic is vulnerable to attack, so other players should attempt to cover a medic who is trying to revive someone.

Each launched rocklet packs a significant explosion that is equally effective against vehicles and infantry. The secondary fire mode fires all remaining rocklets in the clip in rapid succession. However, this mode is considerably less accurate than the primary setting and as such is best relegated for use in short to medium-short range. One of the best uses for this weapon is to clear ACE devices. It can take out a spitfire easily while being outside of its firing radius. It can also detonate mines with one direct rocklet hit. When in secondary fire mode, you can deprive a MAX unit of all armor in mere seconds, leaving it vulnerable to other friendlies to finish it off. It's best to turn auto-reload off when using this weapon, so you can switch to a secondary weapon to finish your target off quickly without waiting for the long reload time, as it's rare to kill a Reinforced Exo-Suit in one clip (since all 6 have to hit).

The Router will allow friends (and foes) to utilize its teleporter beam to instantly move between where the Telepad is deployed and the Router. The Telepad is acquired from a terminal in the back and takes up a pistol slot. The Telepad is simple to deploy, simply push the button of its holster and click where you wish to deploy it. The Telepad can only be deployed within a limited range of the Router (300 meters). One minute after you click, the Telepad will become operational allowing non- IFF transport. To let others take telepads from your Router, set the trunk to empire or group. Placing a telepad renders any active telepads from the same Router inactive, so be careful who you let have access. Like most other vehicles, the Router will automatically deconstruct after five minutes if it loses ownership. Despite being an Ancient Tech vehicle, the Router can be spawned anywhere an AMS can (does not require a Vehicle Module or Cavern Lock ). Similar to an AMS , you can gain Support Experience Points by owning a deployed Router (or deploying a Telepad for one) that friendlies use and then go on to score kills.

However if you have at least the Two Year Term of Service Award , you can acquire the Scorpion without certing Elite Assault. The Scorpion is a straight-trajectory \"smart missile\" that detonates at a range you lock in. While this primary explosion causes little damage, it launches 5 smaller rockets in a 90 degree spread downwards. These smaller rockets detonate after traveling approximately 25 meters, causing massive damage. If three of these rockets detonate in close proximity to an infantry unit, the unit will be killed. However, if either the primary round or secondary rockets hit anything before they reach their explosion distance, they fall to the ground and do not explode or do damage. To fire the Scorpion, you need to zoom in onto a target, then lock on to the selected target with your secondary fire key. This locks the weapon to detonate at that range (you can lock onto anything: a soldier, the ground, a wall, etc). You can then fire in any direction with the primary fire key. Zooming all the way out or firing resets the lock-on range. The Scorpion requires the target to be at least 50.5 meters away before it will lock on, which the Scorpion indicates. It cannot fire at targets over 301.7 meters away either. The secondary rockets have a predictable explosion pattern: two rocklets will always be propelled at a 90 degree angle downwards from the primary explosion. The remaining 3 rocklets explode at random angles. Thus to maximize the probability of hitting your target with at least two rocklets, aim to the left or right of your target so that one of the two predictable rocklets hits the target and hope that another random rocklet explodes close by as well. Note that extreme elevation differentials between you and your target require a little more planning. For example, if you are on a mountain top targeting a soldier by the water's edge, you need to lock on to an object that is slightly closer to you than your intended target or else your rocklets will explode behind your intended target. Similarly, you need to add range to kill a sniper on a mountain far above you or else the rocklets will explode well short of your target. The Scorpion has a rather large learning curve, but once mastered, it's a devastating weapon. The weapon has a rare known issue involving the bomblets not exploding properly.

One night I had a particularly awesome squad. We just clicked and had a great time. We started an outfit and had a ton of fun. When the game released we all met up again on day one and started our outfit. A few of those guys are still around. We have grown into one of the larger outfits and one of the higher point-ranked outfits. Many of our members have been playing with us since close to release. We still have a lot of fun. There is a sense of community that keeps us playing even on the days when the lag makes you wanna put your foot into your screen or the daunting sound of the triple-shot makes you believe there is an NC conspiracy large enough to give you a rage-induced stroke. Our active membership is about 130 with 25-35 players online per day. At peak, we have about 20 members online. Our membership as listed by planetside.com includes close to 100 members who have been inactive for a long time, but who retain their membership because I hope they will return. We use Teamspeak heavily. At first I didn't want to use voice comm... but now I wouldn't play without it. Mags with gunner/driver voice comm are frikkin beautiful. The ability to warn your teammates that there are 4 Vanguards over the hill he is about to cross has saved our Mags a few times... heh. Our forums are interesting and a great place to make plans, share cool new tactics, post screenshots or brag about a nice kill. We believe strongly in the value of defense and spend a lot of time utterly destroying an enemies hope of taking our bases. I love a last minute resecure. Dashing the hopes of the NC and TR makes my day. Sometimes we use gals, sometimes we use vehicle teams and sometimes we just fight in the halls. Variety keeps things interesting. There are few rules, just have fun and treat your fellow players as you would your friends and allies. We have many CR5s. Our CR5s tend to be well-liked and of the non-spamming variety. I believe they all lead well and are appreciated contributors to the CR5 team. I really enjoy being a member of Sons of Vanu and I think you would too. Its a fun group.

SOE is best known for creating EverQuest, Star Wars Galaxies, and PlanetSide , which all have thousands of subscribers. SOE was originally Verant Interactive. NOTOC History EverQuest EverQuest , which is, by far, Sony Online Entertainment's most popular game, was released on March 16th, 1999. EverQuest can be seen as Sony Online Entertainment and Verant Interactive's start, as an internal Sony division, Sony Interactive Studios America (SISA), which was formed in 1995, put John Smedley in charge of the development of a game that would become EverQuest . Brad McQuaid and Steve Clover were hired as programmers for EverQuest . Sony Online Entertainment was born in April 1998 when Sony Online Ventures with Sony Pictures Entertainment. SISA became 989 Studios, and EverQuest , which was credited as being developed by 989 Studios and published by SOE, entered beta at around this time. Most of 989 Studios began to focus on PlayStation development, while the online division spun off and, at first, became RedEye Interactive and then finally becoming known as Verant Interactive. EverQuest became immensely popular and gained ten expansion packs, a sequel, and numerous spin off games. Star Wars Galaxies In April of 2000, SOE hired Raph Koster and Rich Vogel from the Ultima Online development team to develop a new game entitled Star Wars Galaxies . This was a new foray into massively multiplayer online gaming, combining a popular franchise into a massively multiplayer setting. The game attempted to attract a large fanbase with a popular franchise. SWG was released in 2003 and saw rapid growth to 300,000 subscribers but hasn't seen major growth since then. Star Wars Galaxies has received two expansion packs, Jump to Lightspeed and Rage of the Wookies . Currently the game is experiencing a major overhaul labled as the NGE. SOE has decided to focus on a younger age group that lets you take missions for heros and villians from the movies instead of building your own cities and such like it was for the past 2 years. New Ideas Sony Online Entertainment has taken several new leaps in Massively Multiplayer Online gaming with the releases of PlanetSide and EverQuest Online Adventures . PlanetSide was one of the first massively multiplayer online first person shooters, while EverQuest Online Adventures was one of the first PS2 MMORPG's. Neither turned out to be as popular as SOE's other MMO's, but SOE still maintains them regardless. Current State Currently, John Smedley is the president of Sony Online Entertainment. It is headquartered in San Diego, California with studios in Austin, Texas and Seattle, Washington. Sony Online Entertainment released EverQuest II , but it still maintains many of it's older games, including the original EverQuest and PlanetSide . On January 17, 2005, SOE announced it's new feature called Station Publishing, which is a new label for distributing titles made by other developers. The first games under this process are Turbine's Asheron's Call: Throne of Destiny and Ahseron's Call: Throne of Destiny expansion packs.

They quickly were snatched up by a Tactical Outfit, the Band of Bros. Both Soldiers excelled in the game, and in making leadership decisions, leading to their quick promotion to officer rank. One of those Soldiers excelled so much that the outfit leader, one NemisisOrion, Gave the outfit to him when he left the game. That Soldier was Soulkeeper. Since most of the experienced players left with NemisisOrion, Soulkeeper had to build the outfit back up. After a couple of months of hard work doing that rebuild, NemisisOrion came back, and wanted control of the outfit again, which Soulkeeper relinquished peacefully. NemisisOrion used a diffrent leadership style than Soulkeeper, which many new members of the outfit who had never served under NemisisOrion did not like at all. They convinced Soulkeeper to drop from Band of Bros and lead them in a new Outfit, named Soul_Strike. At first there was some bad blood between the newer and older Outfits, but over the years things have smoothed out. Soul_Strike has also gone through periods of turmoil, usually when the Outfit Leader must be gone for extended periods of time. As of December 2006, the Outfit is just coming out of such a recession. Mission Soul_Strike bills itself as a QRF (Quick Reaction Force). As such, it trains its leaders to look for time critical missions. Due to its highly mobile nature, the Outfit favors Galaxy drops, and MBT columns, among other tactics. Soul_Strike also makes extensive use of voice chat as a force multiplier. Leadership Soul_Strike is lead as it always has been by its founder, Soulkeeper. Underneath him are the commanding officers, and underneath them are Tactical commanders.

It deals a good bit of damage per hit with a tight cone of fire , but small clip size. It also suffers severe Damage Degradation (see graph at right), making it relatively worthless at targets over 50 meters away. In the primary firing mode, it fires as a single shot pistol with a tight cone of fire. The secondary mode fires all remaining rounds quickly with a very large cone of fire. You must have at least 75 stamina to fire the secondary mode. The drawback is that this mode drains all remaining stamina , leaving you vulnerable to attack. Thus, you might want to think twice before firing in this mode. There is a short delay before firing begins with the secondary fire mode (much like the Rocklet Rifle ), with a distinct sound. This can sometimes give your target enough warning to move out of the way. At close range, the Spear will kill a soldier wearing Rexo armor in 5 shots. The Eraser and Stinger function identically.

This area's main function is as a location for generating Experience Point rewards. Anyone within the SOI for 15min prior to its capture will receive experience points based on the number and activities of combatants within the sphere. If that person is in a squad , the rest of the squad members on the same continent also share in the reward.

Squad Home Base Squad Home Bases are intended to strengthen group cohesion at the Squad and Platoon levels. The primary functions of the system includes: Squad or Platoon Leaders can view Squad member bind locations. Squad or Platoon Leaders can set a friendly facility as their Sqad/Platoon's Home Base for easy binding. Request that Squad/Platoon members matrix to their self-bind points. Request that Squad/Platoon members recall to Sanctuary. A Commander may use a facility's Main Console to designate it as the Squad's Home Base. The home base will be designated on the planetary and overhead proximity maps by a recognizable waypoint marker (This waypoint is toggleable, just like other waypoints). When a Squad/Platoon Member enters the facility's SOI, they will be asked if they would like to bind to it. This bind will replace the soldier's bind point with a new bind point to the Home Base. When a Commander wants to recall his troops to the home facility, he must go to a friendly facility and issue the Command from that base's Main Console. When a rematrix order is issued, followers who are bound to the home base will receive a pop up box indicating that their commander has issued the order, where they will recall to if they accept the order and a dialog asking if they wish to follow this order. Soldiers who are not bound to the home base will not receive this option but will be notified that their leader has issued the command. Followers will have 60 seconds to accept the recall order and must exit any vehicles before they can. If they accept, all implants will be deactivated and weapons holstered and soldiers will begin the countdown to rematrix to the spawn tubes of that location. Similar to a recall to Sanctuary, if a follower takes damage or takes any action other than typing or viewing the map, the recall countdown will be cancelled. If they are still inside of the 60 second response window, the \"Follow Order\" button will become active again for them to restart their recall. If they are not in the 60 second answer window, the Commander who issued the command will receive a message that the soldier did not respond to the command. If the respawn ability at the Soldier's Bind location becomes unavailable (tubes blown, generator down, base hack goes through and becomes enemy base, etc.) the order will cancel and both the soldier and the leader will receive notification. If a Squad or Platoon's Home Base is captured by an enemy, the waypoint will disappear. If that facility was the soldier's bind location, it will be set to \"none\" and they will receive a message in a center print and chat menu letting them know that their Home Base has been lost. There is a 60 second lock out timer between issuing orders to allow them to be resolved before new orders are passed down. Command Tools There are two different means by which a Leader can activate these features. Major functionality will be accessed through a facility's Main Console . To use the Main Console, a facility has to be secure (unhacked) and fully powered (generator online), have at least one functioning spawn tube and be in the control of the command leader's Empire. In order to interact with the Main Console, it must be repaired beyond 50% just like any other Console in the game. Also, the main Console cannot be hacked by enemies to gain access to its functionality. An Advanced Hacker can hack the main Console of a friendly facility that has been hacked by an enemy Empire , as long as it is powered and has at least one functional spawn tube. Soldiers over Command Rank 2 have access to the Command Uplink Device (CUD) to upload orders and receive information from Empire systems. The Uplink Device does not have the necessary connection to set a base as a \"Home Base\" or to issue a squad rematrix order. However, they can be used to recall the squad or Platoon to Sanctuary and Commanders will be able to receive information on the timers for these abilities. The CUD is able to issue a Recall to Sanctuary order while in the Sanctuary, but other functionality of the CUD is not available (such as firing an Orbital Strike on a Sanctuary). The Squad List has two columns: One displays which facility each Squad member is bound to, and the other is a checkbox that indicates if that Squad member is bound to their Home Base.

The primary functions of the system includes: Squad or Platoon Leaders can view Squad member bind locations. Squad or Platoon Leaders can set a friendly facility as their Sqad/Platoon's Home Base for easy binding. Request that Squad/Platoon members matrix to their self-bind points. Request that Squad/Platoon members recall to Sanctuary. A Commander may use a facility's Main Console to designate it as the Squad's Home Base. The home base will be designated on the planetary and overhead proximity maps by a recognizable waypoint marker (This waypoint is toggleable, just like other waypoints). When a Squad/Platoon Member enters the facility's SOI, they will be asked if they would like to bind to it. This bind will replace the soldier's bind point with a new bind point to the Home Base. When a Commander wants to recall his troops to the home facility, he must go to a friendly facility and issue the Command from that base's Main Console. When a rematrix order is issued, followers who are bound to the home base will receive a pop up box indicating that their commander has issued the order, where they will recall to if they accept the order and a dialog asking if they wish to follow this order. Soldiers who are not bound to the home base will not receive this option but will be notified that their leader has issued the command. Followers will have 60 seconds to accept the recall order and must exit any vehicles before they can. If they accept, all implants will be deactivated and weapons holstered and soldiers will begin the countdown to rematrix to the spawn tubes of that location.

It deals a good bit of damage per hit with a tight cone of fire , but small clip size. It also suffers severe Damage Degradation (see graph at right), making it relatively worthless at targets over 50 meters away. In the primary firing mode, it fires as a single shot pistol with a tight cone of fire. The secondary mode fires all remaining rounds quickly with a very large cone of fire. You must have at least 75 stamina to fire the secondary mode. The drawback is that this mode drains all remaining stamina , leaving you vulnerable to attack. Thus, you might want to think twice before firing in this mode. There is a short delay before firing begins with the secondary fire mode (much like the Rocklet Rifle ), with a distinct sound. This can sometimes give your target enough warning to move out of the way. At close range, the Stinger will kill a soldier wearing Rexo armor in 5 shots. The Eraser and Spear function identically.

Strong leadership, vast collective experience, in-depth informational resources, extensive tools, and a robust forum community are what Sturmgrenadier's all about. Sturmgrenadier Planetside started in closed beta, and to this day we are a very active outfit. Our main objective in this game is to move the map and dominate our enemies on the battlefield, using all the tools at our dispoal. To that end, we have dedicated squads of airborne and mounted infantry, air calvary, and armor. Recruiting Information: Has your outfit disappeared because of the release of WoW?

So was I. Would you like to be involved with an incredible group of men and women who are united by the common purpose of having fun and kicking ass while doing it? People who understand teamwork, communication, and excellence on the battlefield? If this sounds like something you would like to be a part of, I invite you to take a look at Sturmgrenadier (SG). I joined SG in January of 2003 looking for a place to call home. After seeing SG in action, and talking to them in game, I decided to apply and got in. Halfway into the 1-month trial membership, I decided that I found a home and committed to Sturmgrenadier. I have made many friends here, both in game, over TeamSpeak, and in real life, and I look forward to many more years of brother-and-sisterhood. SG offers to its members: - A free 30 day trial with access to everything before you decide whether this is the place for you. - A Charter and accompanying Code of Conduct that is applied impartiality to everyone, both Command and rank-and-file. - Very active community of over 800 members, both over Teamspeak and our forums, with over 100,000 posts in the past year. - The possibility for advancement. Leadership and bravery are rewarded, and if you are interested in a leadership position, those who demonstrate their abilities will be recognized and promoted. - If you play more than one game, SG has organized Portals in Planetside, EVE Online, World of Warcraft, Star Wars Galaxies, America\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s Army, and WW2 Online.

This can include healing other players, repairing other players and vehicles , reviving fallen comrades, Hacking Terminals and Lockers for your teammates to use, and driving the support vehicles. Infantry Support Infantry Support includes the activity of healing or repairing other soldiers as well as reviving other soldiers. This is one of the most important support activities, as without it, soldiers would die far too quickly to be effective. Healing and Repairing Two of the most basic support activies, but possibly two of the most important. Without this, soldiers would not last more than two duels, as their health and armor would be far too low to go on. This is where the medic and engineer come in to heal and repair a soldier to help him fight far longer than he would normally be able to. Available Support Merits: Combat Medic Infantry Armor Support Reviving When a player attains the Advanced Medical certification , that player can use the Medical Applicator to revive a fallen comrade, given that the victim has not yet released to respawn . However, when reviving a player, great care must be taken, as a revived player who has not been repaired at all will often spawn with little to no armor, so it is wise to have an engineer nearby to boost his armor up as well. Available Merit Commendations : Combat Resuscitation Resuscitation Medic Equipment Support Equipment Support involves using a Nano Dispenser from the Engineering certification to repair vehicles , Phalanx turrets, and Spitfires . Generally, it is more difficult to find dedicated Equipment supporters in the field since Nano Dispensers are harder to carry since a player has to sacrifice an entire rifle slot, as opposed to a Body Armor Nano Kit , Medical Applicator, or Remote Electronics Kit , in which the player only has to sacrifice a pistol slot. Available Merit Commendations : Equipment Support Tiny Robotics Support Hacking Support Hacking Support involves using a Remote Electronics Kit along with the Hacking or Advanced Hacking to hack enemy terminals for your Empire to use for a short amount of time.

This is extremely important, as many of these vehicles fill roles that are absolutely necessary for the gameplay to flow.

It allows soldiers to respawn at much closer distances than they would normal be able to, and it gives soldiers who are low on ammo an area to replenish their supplies.

It travels at a speed similar to that of an ATV with its Scythe energy weapon firing at a fairly slow rate, with the weapon's movement independent of the vehicle being limited to only a vertical plane, but when deployed it acts as a turret with a an extremely rapid rate of fire and the weapon being able to fire to the same degree on the vertical plane, but also able to fire fully on the horizontal plane. While terrain and vehicles stop the Scythe weapon projectile (like every other weapon), infantry do not. This means that the weapon can hurt infantry standing behind the first infantry target, enabling the Switchblade to devastate tight clusters of infantry. The Switchblade can also strafe side to side and travel over water (but cannot deploy on water). The main drawback is the switchblade goes through ammo quickly.

The T-REK is, opposed to the normal REK, a far more offensive type of equipment. The T-REK's abilities are aimed at crippling the enemy forces in a variety of ways. It can upload viruses into the Main Terminal of an enemy Facility causing certain benefits of that Facility to be temporarily lost, it can disrupt enemy vehicles causing certain problems like reduced speed and handling or inverted controls (left becomes right, and vice versa) and it can even turn an Empires own equipment against it. There are 5 different types of viruses that can be uploaded into an enemy Facility through its Main Terminal ( see Virus for more information ). Viruses will last for the their duration unless an enemy Expert Hacker or Electronics Expert removes the virus. It will take 30 seconds after the virus has been uploaded for the enemies to be alerted. Once that happens, all warning lights in the Facility will start flashing green, covering the interior of the base in an eery glow.

The Telepad then allows front-line troops to create an instantaneous two-way Teleporter between the point where the Telepad is placed, and it's linked Router . The Telepad is placed on the ground, and then takes one minute to activate, upon which the link is formed. Once active, the telepad can be destroyed by any weapon by hitting the largest telepad fragment at the top. It must be placed where there is room for a soldier to materialise, and has a range of 300m -- about the distance from Tower to Base Spawn Room. Telepads also have an interference range similar to that of an AMS , thus another telepad cannot be placed close to an already active one. Like other deployables, a telepad placed by you can be deconstructed by double clicking on its icon on the Continental Map and selecting to deconstruct it. The link is not IFF Aware, so enemy troops may travel back through the link from the Telepad to the Router. If the host Router is hacked, the deployed telepad is destroyed.

These are one-way, but operate cyclically, so just keep stepping into the column until you are at the complex you want. These same teleporters are used in the VR Training areas and allow access to the vehicle range, shooting range, and exit from virtual reality. Ancient Technology Cave Teleporter Rings The Core Combat Caverns are dotted with glowing ring-pairs at strategic places on the floor. These are one-way travel from a cyan ring, to it's matching purple ring, and are typically used instead of stairs in Core buildings, and are only found in the caves, not above ground. Note: if you are still on top of the destination telepad when an enemy unit transports on top of you, you will be killed, and BEP awarded to the enemy. This is a tactic sometimes used by enemy cloakers to kill you instantly (without firing). Router Telepad A deployed Router and correctly placed Telepad form an instantaneous link between them, accessed by stepping into either the beam beneath the Router itself, or the floating telepad dome at the other end.

The Test Server is exactly the same as the other three PlanetSide servers, Emerald , Markov , and Werner , except that the Test Server is used to test future patches . Therefore, the Test Server receives new patches earlier than other servers so that the players of PlanetSide can test them and work out the bugs before the patches go to the live servers. The Test Server is generally less populated than the Live Servers, so to make it easier on the players, characters on the test server are automatically made at Battle Rank 20 so the player does not have to worry about attaining battle ranks for certifications.

This event was preceded by a series of meteor showers and earthquakes that were experienced across the different continents . Finally, on the first day of the event, these messages began arriving. Messages from Military Command: Message 1 On this eve of chaos, Military Command of each empire uploaded a similar high priority message to all soldiers within their empires: Attention Empire: As you are no doubt aware, there has been an unusually high level of seismic activity lately. The cause is unclear, but the situation is being monitored closely. It is believed that the anomalies we have witnessed cease to occur after a certain time of day and we do not expect any further events today. Additional information will follow as it becomes available but be on high alert, as tomorrow is another day. Message 2 This status message has been sent to soldiers of each empire from their Military Command: Attention Empire, The Core has breached our central mainframe and has rewritten vital portions of our replication procedures. The reasons for this attack - if it is an attack - are unclear. Our engineers are trying to get the situation under control, but for the moment the Core's reprogramming has interfered with our ability to reconstruct some vehicle matrices. Fortunately, it appears that our enemies are suffering the same disruption, so while we are without some tools on the battlefield, we should not be at a disadvantage. Further information will be released as it becomes available. Damage Report Each empire has sent the following message to members of their empire: Finally, it is over! Our engineers have deduced how the Core breached our central mainframe, and have strengthened our security to thwart further attacks. We must now figure out how to undo the Core's damage. More information will follow as resolutions are made. Although we can celebrate ending the Core's intrusions, it wasn't without loss: We are no longer able to construct the Lightning , our strongest remaining assault vehicle nor our assault ATV 's.

Capable of equipping all types of grenade rounds ( Fragmentation , Plasma , Jammer ), it is a versatile weapon and can be quite effective in the hands of a seasoned grenadier. The weapon has two fire modes, a primary detonate on contact mode, as well as a secondary two-second- fuse mode that also detonates upon striking an enemy. Ideal uses for the thumper are in Back Door or Tower defense. The two-second-fuse setting allows the user to fire around corners, saturating a target or area without visual contact. In addition, when loaded with a supply of Jammer grenades , they can be quite handy eliminating minefields on Galaxy drops when a Command EMP is not available. Aspiring Special Assault soldiers should start by loading Fragmentation grenades into their Thumper. Many new players complain of a prompt grief-lock due to accidental team damage while using the Thumper, often while launching Plasma grenades . Fragmentation grenades have a smaller explosion radius and lack the aggravated damage-over-time of their Plasma counterparts, and as such, produce less grief for the Thumper user.

Most vehicle weapons are fed directly from the trunk, with the exceptions being the Flail and Switchblade , which use on-board capacitors for their ammunition. Trunks are of varying size in relation to the vehicle's mass and function. Vehicles with weapon systems have a default loadout of ammuntion for their guns loaded into the trunk on creation, but these contents may be changed quickly at a Repair/Rearm Silo , Landing Pad , or Lodestar . These terminals also allow depleted ammunition to be instantly restocked in the trunk, via the vehicle Favorites menu. In emergencies, i.e only Towers and Advanced Mobile Stations available, the trunk may be manually restocked by the driver using the 'Vehicles' tab at any standard Equipment terminal , and carrying the appropriate boxes back to the vehicle's trunk. The trunk may be used to carry any items at all, not just vehicle ammunition, and as most ammo boxes are 4x4, there is usually room for extra items down the sides: extra Armor Canisters , Adaptive Construction Engines , etc. These items will save into any vehicle Favorite preset along with the ammo, provided you have the appropriate certification . (Note: The trunk may be locked like the Driver, Gunner and Passenger seats; set to Driver only, Squad Only and Empire - remember to unlock it if you want your gunner to do a manual reload.)

Details on the LLU are in the online manual. The Lasher now has Damage Degradation . While the projectile still goes the same maximum distance, it now degrades in its strength, as does the lash itself. Lasher damage against armor ( MAXes , vehicles) has been reduced by 30%. The Starfire AA MAX has had its damage degradation removed and its damage has been decreased about 20%. This reduction is only different from the live version at ranges of less than 50 meters. The removal of damage degradation, however, will be very noticable against targets at greater ranges. The Basilisk and the Wraith have been combined into the new 3 point ATV cert . Players who already have Wraith or Basilisk certs will keep the ATV cert for now, but will be \"in debt\" to the certification system by one point. If those players choose to forget the ATV cert, they will have to have 3 available points to buy it again. Dynamically calculated Certification Point system: This is to resolve certain bugs where a player would forget a Certification , but those certification points would not be available to them. An exploit that would force a base to deplete its NTU Silo by destroying the Matrix Panels has been fixed. The Find Waypoint button will no longer be available when selecting a drop location from the HART shuttle. Squadmates in vehicles now have their names displayed in gold. July 31, 2003 - Client-side Patch We will be releasing a client-side patch Thursday, July 31 at 3 AM Pacific. The patch contains the following item: Enemies will no longer appear as moving and invulnerable corpses to the client. Marauder and Enforcer physics and handling have been fixed. A zone crash associated with backpacks has been fixed. Newly created vehicles should no longer deconstruct on the creation pad. Dropped ACEs deconstruct properly. Lightning drivers will no longer lose their reticule while on steep slopes. Improved Availability of Login Servers. In other words, if the Launchpad says a server is up, players will be able to connect to it reliably. Fixed a zone crash from using Warp Gates while in a vehicle with multiple occupants. The planetside_crash.log file now pulls more information to aid in debugging crash issues. An issue with new characters getting stuck in the world has been resolved. A client-side memory leak when zoning was fixed. July 20, 2003 We will be releasing a client-side patch July 20, 2003 at 3 AM Pacific. The patch will contain the following: Bug fixes: Spawn tube doors are fixed, this also fixes numerous issues where hacked doors would not open. Players who have more than 100 health due to empire balance adjustments will have full health bars. Players with 1 health point will no longer appear dead on your client. Your UI settings will now persist between logins. You will no longer have a strange chat message appear when you are revived. Liberator and Skyguard certifications appear on myPlanetside. You can no longer get stuck in offline training mission 1 if you clear your inventory. /who teams results are now formatted correctly. /ignore player results are now formatted correctly. Additions: Medic/Engineer/Hacker icons will appear over friendly heads if they are holding the associated tool, i.e. Medical Applicator, BANK, Nano-dispenser, REK. Advanced medics are able see dead people who have not yet released their corpses on the proximity radar when they have a Medical Applicator equipped. Likewise, dead players who have not yet release their corpse can see the position of Advanced Medics who are holding the Medical Applicator. Changes: Faster clean up of objects based on object density. In other words, if there are many objects appearing, such as backpacks and destroyed vehicles, they will decay faster. This is intended to help client and server performance in large battles. Grief Points work on a sliding scale, where grief accumulates faster as a player accumulates more points in a brief period of time. The threshold for grief accumulation to begin moving up this sliding scale has been increased. This should reduce the grief generated in extended vehicle collisions. Change to nano-dispenser fire effect. Performance monitor can be toggled pressing Shift and the period key. This will allow you to view your framerate and ping times and packet loss. The Lasher's refire rate was increased, lashes more often and in a slightly larger space. The Thresher's flux cannon damage has been increased 50% against players and its range has been increased 50%. The maximum Cone of Fire on the Mini-Chaingun has been reduced. The Cone of Fire expansion now starts later in the burst and expands more slowly. The Skyguard's flak cannon range has been doubled. Marauder health increased by 1/3. Thresher health increased by 1/3. Empire logos on HART dropships are fixed and look better. The Lightning now sports 360-degree turrets. The Hotspot threshold has been decreased. Six people involved in a battle will generate a Hotspot. Hotspots will also last longer. Updated physics engine to Karma 1.3. Client-Side Patch - July 11, 2003 A client-side patch is being released today that should resolve many of the crash issues related to sound that players were experiencing. Test Server Patch - July 10, 2003 A patch to the Test Server is currently available that should resolve crash issues related to sound cards. Please post your feedback on the Test Patch to the Test Server Feedback Forum. July 9, 2003 - Small client patch A small patch went in today that improves framerate in certain problem situations. We will also continue in improving framerate optimizations. There are no other changes associated with this patch. July 4, 2003 - Server-side patch The servers were brought down this morning for a brief server-side patch that should resolve the issues experienced after the July 3 patch. We apologize for the inconvenience these issues may have caused you. Liberator (7-3-03) Client and Server-side patch (July 3, 2003 2:45PM Pacific on All Servers) The 3-Person bomber known as the Liberator is now available. The cost is 3 Certification points. Certain issues with doors have been fixed. July 2, 2003 Introducing the PlanetSide Test Server Today, we are introducing the much anticipated Test Server for PlanetSide. Stop in and preview the new features, content and fixes before they hit the live server. The Liberator will be making its debut on the Test Server today as well. Here's how to get to the PlanetSide Test Server preview: Patch Planetside normally. Copy (do not move) the entire Planetside directory to a new location on your computer. In the PS directory, find \"PlanetSideTest.exe\" Make a shortcut to the test patcher on your desktop. Run the patcher and, if desired, hit \"play\" to enter the Planetside test environment. You'll go to a server selection where three servers will be listed. Select the \"Public Test\" server. At this point you'll be able to enter \"Public Test\" normally. Client and Server-side fix (6/21/03 3:30AM Pacific on All Servers) This is a client and server-side fix that will take approximately 1.5 hours to update all the servers. Fixed a crash related to the Orbital Strike . The ability to purchase a Liberator certification has been removed until the Liberator is available in-game (very soon). Note that you can still sell back the Liberator certification (regular cert sell-back rules apply). Certain voice assets were swapped incorrectly between male and female, but are now fixed. Hotspots should be working as intended. Various fixes to the Skyguard are made in this patch, including its display on the radar and on the statistics page, as well as various animation and sound related fixes. Server-side fix (6/7/03, 3am) A fix was made that prevents characters from being \"stuck in the world\" and unable to log onto a specific server. This patch doesn't affect very many players, but they were unable to play while this bug existed. It's resolved now. An extremely rare server performance issue occurred today on Markov. That is now resolved. Server-side fix (6/6/03) The zone crash that affected Cyssor on Emerald last night has been resolved. All servers were updated with that fix. Server-side fix (6/5/03, 6pm Central) A server-side fix was made to fix the lag issues seen today. That is resolved now and all servers are updated with that fix. Server-side fix (6/5/03) A stability fix was made to the servers this morning. All updates have occurred and the servers are back up and running. Small downloadable patch (5/31/03) The reports of a lockup bug continued to accumulate, so we came in today to make a fix. The fix is client-side only and does not require a server cycling. Just patch and enter the game. Server-side Fixes (5/30/03) The \"first-time experience\" exploits are prevented. In addition to the fixes made yesterday (that sealed up 90+% of those exploits) we have also resolved an issue affecting some users where the first-time event wouldn't be permanently registered. That's resolved now and first-time experience is (properly) one-time only. A large memory leak was located and squashed on the servers. This stabilizes our worlds further. A logic error in base capture experience has been found. The system is now changed so that a) squads that participate in captures will typically gain more xp than in the previous system, and b) the exploitability of the system by \"cap squatters\" (individuals from squads slipping in at the last minute to rake xp without risk and sharing that bonus with other squadmembers who were also not at risk) are virtually eliminated. Additionally, the xp awards for resecuring a base (hacking the console back after attackers have initially hacked it) have been increased substantially, so defenders that stick around and fight to retake a base should see increased xp awards for doing so. NOTE: These xp changes apply equally to lone wolves as well as squads. Both will see increases. Holiday Game Updates (12/21/2006) Update Features More Holiday Fun: Watch out for the new objects appearing all over Auraxis during the holiday. In certain locations you might run across a snowman, gingerbread man, sled, or xmas tree.

The bug was introduced with patch 3.12.12 . Anniversary 2007 Update (5/18/2007) Happy Four Year Anniversary, PlanetSide! For PlanetSide's Four Year Anniversary, we designed three New Pistols (one for each empire), a Missile Launcher with Propelled Explosives, and an experimental Flamethrower weapon. Each weapon can be obtained by every player with the exception of the Flamethrower. As you read the details below, you'll notice that there are a few limiting factors on the Missile Launcher and the Flamethrower. However, take note that we have enabled all weapons to be available to all players from 5/18/07 to 5/25/07 regardless of the limitations. We wanted everyone to have the chance to try out the new weapons and participate in the mayhem of the Four Year Anniversary! Enjoy! PISTOLS - The Spear ( NC ) / The Stinger ( TR ) / The Eraser ( VS ) These Empire specific pistols are designed to be very lethal towards Infantry units but lack a punch in the armor piercing department 10mm Pistols Very powerful versus infantry units Primary firing mode is an automatic single shot, capable of firing long distances with better than average accuracy Primary firing mode has a slower rate of fire Secondary firing mode will unload all remaining rounds in the clip to produce a high amount of damage Secondary firing mode has a side effect: your stamina will be completely drained, so use it with caution Secondary firing also has a large cone of fire so be close to your enemy units if you want to do massive damage Pistols deliver very low damage towards vehicles and equipment MISSILE LAUNCHER with PROPELLED EXPLOSIVE - The Scorpion The Scorpion uses a range-finder technology to fire 'smart' missiles from long distances Built in Range Finder to lock in distances where your enemies are \"dug-in\" Launches 'smart' missiles to the locked in distance while carrying grenade type bombs, unleashing several smaller explosives in every direction Ability to zoom long distances to establish locked in range (unable to shoot at close targets) Hitting objects before the missile reaches the locked in range will disable the missile's arming ability Available without any certification cost to 2 year veterans (based on your character's creation date) If not a 2 year veteran, it may be purchased for 1 certification point if Special Assault has already been learned FLAMETHROWER - The Dragon The Dragon is a powerful flamethrower that works best at close ranges. The Dragon is an experimental weapon and may not be accessible at all times in PlanetSide. Due to the special effects of the flames, the Dragon may be removed from many playing conditions that cause adverse performance issues. Although many limitations have been put in place to limit performance issues, the Dragon will be classified experimental until such performance issues are deemed non-existent or believed to be minor. The Primary fire mode unleashes a stream of fire for short range tactics. The fire is slow moving that is very devastating to anyone caught in the way This stream can be released in short bursts or until your fuel is gone Secondary fire mode launches a concentrated ball of fire called a Sunburst that will explode after a short time or when it hits the ground. The Sunburst's explosion deals massive damage to anyone in range. If Sunburst is close enough to the ground, it will also scatter small fires around that burn anyone who tries to walk through it. Secondary fire mode requires fuel capacity to be at its maximum Fire from Primary and Secondary fire modes will not only directly hurt soldiers passing through armor, but it will ignites them as well The Dragon is only useable by 3 year veterans (based on your character's creation date) and includes a three minute purchase timer 6th Anniversary Update (6/18/2009) Free certification reset Increased maximum Battle Rank from 25 to 40 Added 6 year Term of Service merit BR32 Fix (6/17/2009) Patch fixes issues with Battle Rank 32+ players causing others to crash and other weird anomalies.

This years event will run from October 22nd through November 2nd, and feature some really howling experience gains. Base captures like you've never seen before, cavern captures that will make you want you want get that next BFR imprint , and much more! So go ahead and spend some time with us and let\u2019s get that much needed Battle Experience and see if we can reach Battle Rank 40... If you dare!!! The Chainblade Massacre will also pop up from time to time throughout the Spooktacular Days so be prepared! All players will be able to use Cloaking infiltration suits without need of the certification on Extinction (this is our version of ghosts). In true Halloween tradition, players will only be allowed to use a Knife to kill other players.

The Spooktacular Days are now over and all systems have been restored back to normal. Thank you and we'll see you on the Battle Field! Game Update (12/09/2009) Greetings Auraxians! We are pleased to announce to everyone that PlanetSide now supports both Windows Vista and Windows 7. While players could work around the compatibility issues with Vista and Windows 7 before, the client should now be completely functional without having to use compatibility mode and/or other tricks. We appreciate your patience with this change and please make sure that you spread the word to all your fallen Vista and Windows 7 comrades! category:Patches","title":"Unnumbered Patches"},{"location":"Unnumbered_Patches/#llu-goes-live-august-14-2003","text":"We are releasing a patch to the client and server on August 14, 2003 that contains the following items: Facility capture takes on a whole new level of action now that the Lattice Logic Unit is live! Details on the LLU are in the online manual. The Lasher now has Damage Degradation . While the projectile still goes the same maximum distance, it now degrades in its strength, as does the lash itself. Lasher damage against armor ( MAXes , vehicles) has been reduced by 30%. The Starfire AA MAX has had its damage degradation removed and its damage has been decreased about 20%. This reduction is only different from the live version at ranges of less than 50 meters. The removal of damage degradation, however, will be very noticable against targets at greater ranges. The Basilisk and the Wraith have been combined into the new 3 point ATV cert . Players who already have Wraith or Basilisk certs will keep the ATV cert for now, but will be \"in debt\" to the certification system by one point. If those players choose to forget the ATV cert, they will have to have 3 available points to buy it again. Dynamically calculated Certification Point system: This is to resolve certain bugs where a player would forget a Certification , but those certification points would not be available to them. An exploit that would force a base to deplete its NTU Silo by destroying the Matrix Panels has been fixed. The Find Waypoint button will no longer be available when selecting a drop location from the HART shuttle.

Additionally, the xp awards for resecuring a base (hacking the console back after attackers have initially hacked it) have been increased substantially, so defenders that stick around and fight to retake a base should see increased xp awards for doing so.

Each weapon can be obtained by every player with the exception of the Flamethrower. As you read the details below, you'll notice that there are a few limiting factors on the Missile Launcher and the Flamethrower. However, take note that we have enabled all weapons to be available to all players from 5/18/07 to 5/25/07 regardless of the limitations. We wanted everyone to have the chance to try out the new weapons and participate in the mayhem of the Four Year Anniversary! Enjoy! PISTOLS - The Spear ( NC ) / The Stinger ( TR ) / The Eraser ( VS ) These Empire specific pistols are designed to be very lethal towards Infantry units but lack a punch in the armor piercing department 10mm Pistols Very powerful versus infantry units Primary firing mode is an automatic single shot, capable of firing long distances with better than average accuracy Primary firing mode has a slower rate of fire Secondary firing mode will unload all remaining rounds in the clip to produce a high amount of damage Secondary firing mode has a side effect: your stamina will be completely drained, so use it with caution Secondary firing also has a large cone of fire so be close to your enemy units if you want to do massive damage Pistols deliver very low damage towards vehicles and equipment MISSILE LAUNCHER with PROPELLED EXPLOSIVE - The Scorpion The Scorpion uses a range-finder technology to fire 'smart' missiles from long distances Built in Range Finder to lock in distances where your enemies are \"dug-in\" Launches 'smart' missiles to the locked in distance while carrying grenade type bombs, unleashing several smaller explosives in every direction Ability to zoom long distances to establish locked in range (unable to shoot at close targets) Hitting objects before the missile reaches the locked in range will disable the missile's arming ability Available without any certification cost to 2 year veterans (based on your character's creation date) If not a 2 year veteran, it may be purchased for 1 certification point if Special Assault has already been learned FLAMETHROWER - The Dragon The Dragon is a powerful flamethrower that works best at close ranges. The Dragon is an experimental weapon and may not be accessible at all times in PlanetSide. Due to the special effects of the flames, the Dragon may be removed from many playing conditions that cause adverse performance issues. Although many limitations have been put in place to limit performance issues, the Dragon will be classified experimental until such performance issues are deemed non-existent or believed to be minor. The Primary fire mode unleashes a stream of fire for short range tactics. The fire is slow moving that is very devastating to anyone caught in the way This stream can be released in short bursts or until your fuel is gone Secondary fire mode launches a concentrated ball of fire called a Sunburst that will explode after a short time or when it hits the ground. The Sunburst's explosion deals massive damage to anyone in range. If Sunburst is close enough to the ground, it will also scatter small fires around that burn anyone who tries to walk through it. Secondary fire mode requires fuel capacity to be at its maximum Fire from Primary and Secondary fire modes will not only directly hurt soldiers passing through armor, but it will ignites them as well The Dragon is only useable by 3 year veterans (based on your character's creation date) and includes a three minute purchase timer","title":"Anniversary 2007 Update (5/18/2007)"},{"location":"Unnumbered_Patches/#6th-anniversary-update-6182009","text":"Free certification reset Increased maximum Battle Rank from 25 to 40 Added 6 year Term of Service merit","title":"6th Anniversary Update (6/18/2009)"},{"location":"Unnumbered_Patches/#br32-fix-6172009","text":"Patch fixes issues with Battle Rank 32+ players causing others to crash and other weird anomalies.","title":"BR32 Fix (6/17/2009)"},{"location":"Unnumbered_Patches/#server-merge-and-lasher-nerf-08252009","text":"Players moving from Werner to Gemini will receive a Werner Distinguished Veteran Merit Players who receive a -W or -G appended to their names will be allowed a one-time use of the /rename command Outfits that receive a -W or -G appended to their names will be allowed a one-time use of the /outfitrename command (leader only) We have increased the minimum number of characters allowed from 8 to 24 The Lasher 's LASH damage has been significantly reduced The Lasher's AP Damage has been reduced (while in AP mode) (Not actually implemented in-game for unknown reasons)","title":"Server Merge and Lasher nerf (08/25/2009)"},{"location":"Unnumbered_Patches/#game-update-10152009","text":"Fixed a bug where players with the five year Term of Service award were unable to purchase Reinforced Exo-Suit armor in the Sanctuary and Amerish without the certification Dramatically increased BEP and CEP awarded for facility captures (later rolled back in a patch shortly afterward)","title":"Game Update (10/15/2009)"},{"location":"Unnumbered_Patches/#game-update-10222009","text":"It's that time of year again when all the Ghouls and Goblins come out to play however this year they've decided to change things up a bit, gone are the flying skulls and red glowing skies which have been replaced with the Spooktacular Bonus Experience Days.

In PlanetSide, there are many different types of vehicles, from mobile spawn points to huge lumbering robots to ten person APC's. Planetside currently has 38 different ground and air vehicles (not including HART shuttles and Drop Pods ), each with radically different attributes. Almost every vehicle has at least one type of onboard weapons system - the exceptions are the AMS , ANT , Lodestar , Phantasm , Router , and Wraith (though all have important capabilities). Some vehicles are only available to members of a particular Empire , while others are available to all. Any unoccupied vehicle may be jacked (stolen) by an enemy advanced hacker . Acquiring a Vehicle Acquiring a vehicle in PlanetSide is slightly more involved than in other First Person Shooters. Not everyone is qualified to drive every vehicle, and a player must first go through a slight process before being able to acquire and drive a vehicle. Certifications Before you can even get a vehicle, you must have the correct certification . Certain certifications yield different vehicles, and while some of the certifications yield what vehicle the certification name is, certain certifications come in \"bundles\". Certain vehicles are also granted under multiple certifications, so careful certification management is important when applying for certain vehicles. The list of vehicular certifications is as follows: ATV Switchblade Harasser Light Scout Assault Buggy Armored Assault I Armored Assault II Flail BattleFrame Robotics BFR Anti-Infantry BFR Anti-Aircraft Ground Transport Ground Support Air Cavalry, Scout Air Cavalry, Assault ( Light Scout can be used in place of Air Cavalry, Scout as a pre-requisite) Air Cavalry, Interceptor (Light Scout can be used in place of Air Cavalry, Scout as a pre-requisite) Air Support Galaxy Gunship Phantasm (requires Infiltration Suit ) In addition, any player has access to the Advanced Nanite Transport . Merits In addition to certifications, certain vehicles require the player to have a certain Merit Commendation before they can be purchased or driven. The vehicles and their requirements are listed below: Vulture : Bomber Ace Bronze Flight-Variant BFRs ( Invader , Eclipse , or Eagle ) : BFR Basic Vehicle Terminal is a vehicle which requires a Technology Plant .]] Once a player has the correct certification, a player can purchase the vehicle from a friendly or hacked Vehicle Terminal . However, some Vehicle Terminals are restricted to either air or ground vehicles, and some vehicles can only be purchased when certain requirements are met. Also, after every vehicle purchase, the same vehicle cannot be purchased for 5 minutes, unless you are at a base which has a Vehicle Module , in which the timer is reduced to 2:30. In short, vehicles that are under Air Cavalry Scout , Air Cavalry Assault , the Liberator and the Vulture from Air Support and the Phantasm can be purchased at Air Vehicle Terminals. All of the above vehicles as well as the Galaxy , Galaxy Gunship and Lodestar from Air Support can be purchased at a Dropship Vehicle Terminal. BFR 's can only be purchased at BFR Terminals . Any other vehicle can be purchased from a Ground Vehicle Terminal. However, there are still some other restrictions.

Keymapping In PlanetSide, a player has to be very careful when remapping keys for vehicle controls. There are four pages for controls for vehicles, and it is important to understand what each of them do before making mistakes with your key bindings. Vehicle Controls Vehicle controls are the keys that are used for all vehicles, regardless of whether they are air or ground vehicles. The exception to this rule is BFR 's, as they have their own key mapping and does not use any of these key mappings. These are the default Vehicle Controls.

The Vehicle Armor Status icon defaults in the lower left hand corner and shows up as an icon which represents your vehicle. This slowly turns from green to red as your vehicle sustains damage. Alternately, this can be turned into a simpler bar which becomes part of the bottom toolbar on the HUD. With BFR 's, the icon also gives the player a status on certain BFR subsystems, denoting their damage through colors, either green, yellow, or red. BFR 's and vehicles who had their shield generators charged from an Amp Station 's benefits have a blue ring around their vehicle icon to show shield strength. Also, at the same time, there is a blue bar at the bottom of the HUD on the toolbar to denote shield strength as well. After an Advanced Nanite Transport has gone to a warpgate and gathered NTU 's, a gray bar which reads \"NTU Level\" shows up on the bottom toolbar. This denotes how many NTU's are stored on the ANT that are ready to be transferred to an NTU Silo at a facility . Also, the Mosquito , Reaver , Vulture , Galaxy , Phantasm , and Lodestar all have Afterburners , which is denoted on the HUD by a green bar which reads \"Afterburners\". Gunner and Passenger Spots Most vehicles in PlanetSide are not solo vehicles; rather, they have gunner and passenger slots to make them more teamwork-oriented. In any vehicle, if the driver or any of the gunners scores a kill, the driver and the gunners in the vehicle are also awarded Experience . Also, a gunner or a passenger can always bail from a vehicle, while a driver may not necessarily be able to. Gunner Slots Gunner slots on a vehicle are denoted by a yellow circle around a Pistol symbol. The owner of the vehicle can set who can get into a gunner position using the Vehicle Management Pane. He can set the privacy to a number of levels, including Empire, Squad, and Locked. All types of Armor, besides MAX armor can get into a gunner slot, regardless of the vehicle. Gunners are the main way a vehicle gets kills. While the Driver is the most important slot, generally a driver's weapons, if he has any at all, are weaker than a gunner's weapons. Thus, it is important for the gunner and the driver to coordinate to get the most kills. Also, many of the best driver/gunner combinations use a Voice Over IP program such as Teamspeak or Ventrilo . Merits Through Gunning By gunning for a vehicle, a player can get certain merits. These merits are as follows: Ground Gunner (most ground vehicles) Bombardier (Liberator and Vulture) Air Defender (Skyguard) Cavalry Pilot (Galaxy Gunship) troop transport.]] Passenger Slots Other vehicles operate as transport vehicles, and have passenger slots. These spots on a vehicle are denoted by a yellow circle with a chair inside it. Any armor besides MAX Armor can climb into passenger slots and go for a ride. For new characters, this is probably the easiest way to travel, as many new characters do not have the certification points required to acquire a vehicle yet. MAX Passenger Slots The Leviathan , Juggernaut , Vindicator , and Galaxy have two positions which can be occupied by players wearing MAX Armor. Players wearing a Infiltration Suit , Standard Exo-Suit , Agile Exo-Suit , or a Reinforced Exo-Suit may not utilze these spots on a vehicle. These slots are denoted by a yellow circle with a MAX Icon in the middle. Vehicle Bay Both the Galaxy and the Lodestar have a vehicle bay which can transport smaller ground vehicles in the air. The Galaxy has a much smaller vehicle bay and can therefore only transport certain vehicles. These vehicles are: Advanced Nanite Transport Basilisk Fury Wraith Switchblade Harasser Enforcer Marauder Thresher Skyguard Lightning A Lodestar can carry any ground vehicle, including BFRs .

It has a smaller payload but improved speed and handling, as well as afterburners. It lacks the pilot's downward-facing 'bomber mode' camera and cannot equip anti-infantry cluster bombs. The pilot's 35mm nose cannon has a high rate of fire and more focused armor damage, but is less damaging to infantry and aircraft. There also less rounds per clip, with only 75 which can be completely spent in approximately 5 seconds. The bombs that the Vulture carries are significantly more powerful against armor than the anti-armor bombs of a standard Liberator. A standard A/V bomb does 600 damage, and the Vulture's bombs do 1500 damage. This increase in power is offset by the fact that it carries less bombs and only permits five bombs per clip. The release rate of the bombs is also somewhat slower, as it the fall speed. Vultures can also release bombs at a slightly lower altitude than the Liberator. Their combination of superior speed and maneuverability with the limitations of bomb payload make the Vulture best suited to low level close support bombing. The tailgun of the Vulture also differs from the Liberator. The Vulture's tailgun holds only 100 rounds per clip instead of 150, but it is more powerful than that of the liberator, and can be used against ground targets with much success. The trunk of the Vulture is slightly smaller than the Liberator, able to carry 8 4x4 boxes instead of 9 like the Liberator. Because of this, Liberator favorites cannot be seamlessly loaded into the Vulture, requiring a seperate favorite slot for dedicated Vulture users. Only experienced Liberator pilots are cleared to operate Vulture. Obtaining one from a flight vehicle terminal will require not only the Air Support certification, but also a Bomber Ace Bronze Merit Commendation . Like the Liberator, the Vulture requires a Technology Plant lattice link or Sanctuary vehicle pad in order to be purchasable.

There are 3 to 4 warpgates located on each continent and sanctuary , each linked to a planet light years away. If the warpgate's host continent is locked , or it is linked to a locked continent via a continental lattice chain, it becomes a Broadcast Warpgate (BWG) and can transport an individual across the Galactic Lattice to any planet in the lattice chain. You cannot enter warpgates that link to an enemy sanctuary (found on enemy Home Continents ). These warpgates are shaded the color of the controling empire on the Continental Map . The bubble will act as a solid structure for enemies (thus you cannot fill up an ANT in these enemy warpgates). Structurally, a warpgate consists of a large central platform, from which emits a column of warp energy that shoots up and then encloses the entire construct from top to bottom in a protective warp bubble. Three thick support bracings extend outward from this central platform like spokes on a wheel, each an equal distance from the other two. From these spokes curve upward and inward three massive columns. The warpgates are the land-based alternative to the High Altitute Rapid Transit Shuttle (HART) . Game Lore The warpgates were the first Ancient artifacts discovered and inspected by the Terran Republic expeditionary teams. It was the warp energy signatures passing through the gates and along the lattice network that the scientists were able to harness to create the weaponry, vehicles, and equipment. The warpgates were also the first source of human Re-birthing, later known as respawning . After a human passed through the warpgate energy beam, he could no longer stay dead. Instead he would respawn within one of the warpgates scattered throughout the Pre-Bending planet of Auraxis . The Terran scientists utilized this amazing property of the warpgates to create the Matrix Panels and Respawn tubes used in the various facilities on each continent . It is said that the scientists discovered how to create approximations of the Ancients ' vehicles and weaponry by studying the warpgate energy. Every day, the scientists and technicians of each Empire attempt to decipher the warpgate energy patterns, testing ways to manipulate them for their own ends in order to dominate the galaxy.

These are visible to all members of the squad the CR1 is leading, and are shared between squads in a platoon .

They are practically essential to do anything in PlanetSide, as PlanetSide is a war simulator and weapons are the basis of any war. The weapons in PlanetSide are highly diversified, from grenade launchers to shotguns to sniper rifles. Understanding the differences between the weapons is important to understanding PlanetSide. Because of the multitude of weaponry available to a player in PlanetSide, it is very easy to get overwhelmed. Knowing when to use each weapon is very important, but playing through the game normally will eventually teach a player which weapons to use in what circumstances. Every weapon in PlanetSide serves some type of purpose, the goal is to learn which weapons to use and when and why. Acquiring Weapons When a player first spawns in PlanetSide, they automatically have a Suppressor , their Empire-Specific pistol, a combat knife, four boxes of standard 9mm ammo, one box of AP 9mm ammo, and one box of whatever ammunition that empire's empire-specific pistol uses. However, to use the more advanced weaponry which is more prevalant on the battlefield, the user has to go through a slight process. Certifications To be able to acquire certain weapons, a player needs certain certifications from a certification terminal . There are only six weapon certifications, and all characters have one of them. The six weapon cerifications are as follows: Standard Assault Medium Assault Heavy Assault Special Assault Sniping Anti-Vehicular All characters are required to have Standard Assault, and Medium Assault is the prerequisite to the other four weapon certifications. Thus, Medium Assault is a very popular certification, and almost every character has it. Merits In addition to this, the Heavy Scout Rifle requires no certification, but it does require the player to have a 2 Year Term of Service to be able to acquire it. Currently, the Heavy Scout Rifle is the only weapon in the game to have such a requirement. Equipment Terminal After a player has the correct certification or Merit , they must purchase the weapons from an equipment terminal . In addition to this, when they purchase a weapon, to be able to use it, they must have the correct type of holster in their armor. Holsters All armors have holsters in them, and certain weapons go into certain holsters. There are two types of holsters: pistol holsters and rifle holsters. Pistol Holsters The pistol holsters on an armor are always going to be slot 1 and sometimes slot 3. These are smaller weapons, as the pistol holster is only 3x3. The weapons that use the pistol holster are: All Empire-Specific pistols AMP Spiker Hand-Held Grenades Even though Hand-Held Grenades are fired through the pistol holster, when stored in the inventory, a handheld grenade only takes up a 2x2 slot of inventory. Rifle Holsters Rifle holsters are much larger, and the Infiltration suit does not even have any rifle slots. Rifle slots are slot 2 and 4, and are reserved for more powerful weapons. These are the weapons that a player will usually use when in combat. The weapons that use the rifle slot are: All Medium Assault weapons except for the Spiker Heavy Assault weapons Special Assault weapons Sniping weapons Anti-Vehicular weapons Although Medium Assault weapons and Special Assault weapons use rifles slots, they do not take up the full 9 x 3 space. This doesn't make a difference in the holster, however, when storing these weapons in normal inventory, they only take up a 6 x 3 space. Ammo When a player purchases a weapon, the weapon only has the ammo that comes in the magazine. To truly utilize a weapon, a player needs to purchase ammo boxes as well. Generally speaking, a weapon needs at least two boxes of ammo to sustain a good amount of time on the battlefield. There are exceptions to this rule, but this is generally speaking. Also, many weapons have two types of ammo: standard ammo and AP ammo. Standard ammo is white in color, and is designed to take out other infantry. AP ammo is gold in color, and is designed to take out enemy MAX 's and vehicles . The only weapons with these sorts of restrictions are Standard Assault , Medium Assault , and Heavy Assault weapons. The exceptions to this rule are Ancient Technology and Vanu Sovereignty weapons. The Beamer and the Pulsar have an inherent AP mode which allows the user to switch to armor piecing on the fly without worrying about different ammo types. The Lasher and the Ancient Technology weapons are already effective against all type of enemies without different ammunition types or firing modes designed specifically for them. Weapon Classes There are over 20 different weapons in PlanetSide, but they can be classified into a few groups of weapons to make it easier to understand. Each and every weapon has a role on the battlefield. Combat Knives The combat knives of PlanetSide are the Chainblade , Mag-Cutter , and Force-Blade . Knives are generally a soldier's last resort, although many Infiltrators do use the combat knives as primary weapons, usually with the help of the Melee Booster implant. Also, all knives have a Force Attack funcion which allows them to become much more powerful, but it emits a loud sound which notifies people to the presence of a knife wielder. No matter what type of armor you're using, the combat knife can always be selected by using, by default, the 5 key. You cannot unselect the knife, as it is part of the body armor, and you will therefore always have it with you. You cannot loot enemy knives. Basic Weapons All characters start with these weapons, as these are the weapons that come with the Standard Assault certification. Pistols Pistols are generally used as back up weapons, although Infiltrators are forced to use these as weapons if they do not use the Combat Knife or the Adaptive Construction Engine . Also, many soldiers use pistols as a back up weapon, since many of them use the same ammo type as their corresponding empire's Medium Assault and Heavy Assault weapons. There are two main classes of pistols, long range pistols and short range pistols. Also, when a player spawns, they will have their Empire-specific pistol with them. Short range pistols are what Infiltrators tend to like to use. These are the AMP and the Mag-Scatter . These weapons are designed to be close range, so, naturally, the Infiltrator, as a generally close range class, can use this to their advantage. Also, many Snipers and Medium Assault users like to take one of these weapons as a close range weapon rather than using their long-range weapons for close range combat. Long range pistols is a slightly misleading name, as these pistols still are not anywhere near Medium Assault range. However, these weapons can be used effectively in ranges over 20 meters, which is somewhat advantageous to Infiltrators, as they can kill enemies outside of the 20 meter Darklight range without fear of being detected by Darklight. The long range pistols are the Beamer and the Repeater , which means the New Conglomerate has no available long range pistol without looting. *Note: The Spiker is also a Long Range pistol but it is classified under Medium Assault and will be talked about later.* Suppressor This is the most basic rifle weapon in the game, and does the lowest damage per shot of any rifle. The Suppressor is incredibly accurate, and can be used for some long range work. However, generally, if a player has a certification above Standard Assault, they don't want to be using the Suppressor. A player spawns with the Suppressor when they first spawn out of a Spawn Tube or AMS . Medium Assault Medium Assault is one of the most bread and butter certifications in the game of PlanetSide. Almost every character has it, as it is the pre-requisite for Heavy Assault , Anti-Vehicular , Sniping , and Special Assault . Medium Assault weapons are all good in all situations, but they do not excel in any one situation. Empire-Specific Assault Rifles These are perhaps the most balanced weapons in the game. They can be used in pretty much any situation, be it long range or short range. These weapons are used by many characters due to their versatility, and are especially newbie friendly due to this. However, even veteran characters use these weapons. These weapons are the Cycler , Gauss , and Pulsar . While these weapons can all be fired in fully automatic, this can only be reliably used in close range combat. For longer range combat, burst firing is preferable to keep the Cone of fire under control. Punisher Another incredibly versatile weapon, the Punisher is not as good as the other three Assault Rifles at being an assault rifle, but it has one major advantage over them: a single shot grenade/rocket launcher. The Punisher, in secondary fire mode, can fire a single grenade or rocket, which expands many of it's uses. The general idea behind the Punisher is to first soften a target using a grenade or rocket, and then to finish them off using normal shots. However, the Punisher suffers from long reloads, as a user not only has to reload the single shot ordinance launcher but also the normal 9mm ammo. Also, to be the most effective with the Punisher, it is most effective to turn Auto-Reload off so that the game doesn't automatically reload the single shot ordinance launcher as soon as you fire so you can switch to the 9mm ammo to finish off a target. Sweeper The Sweeper is the most powerful close range weapon in the Medium Assault certification. As a shotgun, it's use is quickly diminished at longer ranges, but it has a tighter spread than the Heavy Assault weapons and can therefore be used at a slightly longer range. Some players even prefer the Sweeper to it's big brother, the New Conglomerate Jackhammer . However, this all comes down to personal preference. Spiker This is an Ancient Technology pistol with quite an interesting role. Users can charge up the shot, but the longer a shot is charged up, the more ammo is expended. However, fully charged, the Spiker does do quite a bit of damage with quite an impressive splash for a pistol. Infiltrators tend to enjoy using the Spiker, as it has a fairly long range and a good damage ratio. However, careful ammo management is important to get many kills with it. Heavy Weapons One of the most heavily contested and debated about certifications, Heavy Assault is designed to be at the forefront of any attack. It is the most expensive of any hand-held weaponry certification, at four certification points along with the Medium Assault certification, but you still see quite a few weapons from this certification out on the battlefield. These weapons are designed to be room clearers and have a very low time to kill in close range combat. Lasher The Lasher is the Vanu Sovereignty 's Heavy Assault weapon. The Lasher features a \"lash\" which does damage to all surrounding targets after a Lasher orb hits the ground, an enemy, or anything. This makes the Lasher quite an effective indoor room clearer, as the wall and the floor will often lash towards enemies and do damage, even if the Lasher user does not directly hit the enemy. However, the Lasher suffers from incredibly slow projectile speed and high Damage Degradation , which makes the weapon usless after a fairly short range. However, because of the slight lash, a Lasher user can hit enemies around corners, which allows the Lasher to double as a weak Special Assault weapon. Jackhammer The Jackhammer is the New Conglomerate 's Heavy Assault weapon. The JackHammer is an automatic shotgun with a rather high pellet spread but a high damage output. It is the only Heavy Assault with a secondary mode, which is a triple shot mode, where three shotgun slugs are propelled out of the JackHammer in rapid succession. This is an instant kill at close range, but due to the slight pause between switching fire modes, the JackHammer's secondary mode is rarely used, unless in conjuction with the Third Person camera. However, even without it's secondary mode, the JackHammer fills it's role nicely as a room clearer. Mini-Chaingun The Mini-Chaingun is the Terran Republic 's Heavy Assault weapon. The Mini-Chaingun, sometimes shortenned to just MCG, is a rapid firing machine gun with a very high magazine capacity. With 100 shots per magazine, the MCG can pour out quite a bit of lead. However, because of the nature of the weapon, careful cone of fire management is required for slightly longer ranges, but because of this, the MCG has a slightly longer range than the other two Heavy Assault weapons. However, to be utilized the most efficiently, an MCG user must crouch, even in close range combat to minimize the cone of fire. Maelstrom The Maelstrom is an Ancient Technology Heavy Assault weapon. The Maelstrom is an incredibly versatile weapon which has both potential for anti-personnel and anti-armor use. In primary mode, a vortex whip comes out of the end of the Maelstrom, which, while it does not do as much damage as the normal Heavy Assault weaponry, can be used if needed. The secondary mode fires a grenade which does quite a bit of damage and can lash, similarily to the Lasher , through walls and around corners. The final mode is the same as the secondary mode, except there is a two-second fuse on the grenade, which allows the weapon to be used as Special Assault. Sniper Rifles Sniper Rifles are the handheld infantry weapons with the longest range, and are quite useful in outdoor battles. Generally, they pale in close range combat, but they can be used in close range battle if needed. All sniper rifles come with an 8x zoom, which is very helpful. However, unlike other FPS's, there are no one-hit kills, even with sniper rifles, since there is no are-based hit detection. Bolt Driver The Bolt Driver was the only Sniper Rifle in the game for two years. It has the highest damage per shot of any handheld infantry weapon in the game, doing 100 damage in total. However, a player wearing any armor besides an Infiltration suit will have some of the damage absorbed by armor, so therefore, it usually takes two shots to down an infantry. The cone of fire is too wide while standing to be used in long range, so therefore, snipers must crouch to do long distance damage. Also, a Sniper must practice a technique called leading to hit moving targets. Leading involves moving the crosshair in front of where an enemy is moving so that the crosshair will settle before they reach it and so that, while the bullet is in flight, the target will move into the bullet. Heavy Scout Rifle The Heavy Scout Rifle is similar to the Bolt Driver in many ways, using the same ammo type and having almost the same animations, but it differs from the Bolt Driver in two important ways: damage and refire rate. The Heavy Scout Rifle is noticably weaker than the Bolt Driver, taking 2 - 5 shots to down an infantry, but it has a 10 round magazine which allows it to be fired rapidly in semi-automatic mode. However, the cone of fire blooms after every shot, so cone of fire management is very important. Anti-Vehicular Weapons Anti-Vehicular weapons are an infantryman's best way to deter vehicles. These weapons are not designed to allow an infantry to solo most vehicles; rather, most are designed to simply deter a vehicle or to destroy a vehicle when many of these weapons are grouped together. Vehicle destruction takes teamwork, otherwise, these weapons are very good at deterring vehicles that would normally annihilate infantry. Long Range Weaponry The Empire-Specific Anti-Vehicular weaponry tend to lend themselves better for outdoor work. These are much longer ranged, and, while they can be used effectively indoors, tend to shine in outdoors combat. Lancer The Lancer is the Vanu Sovereignty's Anti-Vehicular weapon. This features a fast travelling bolt which does quite an impressive bit of damage to vehicles. The Lancer has a charge up time of about a second, which means the user has to lead targets not only for the bolt travelling time, but also for the charge up time. Learning how much to lead is a learned skill which takes time. The Lancer has an effective range of 300 meters, which gives it a 50 meter advantage over the other Empire-Specific Anti-Vehicular Weaponry. Phoenix The Phoenix is the New Conglomerate's Anti-Vehicular weapon. The Phoenix features a guided missile, which allows the user to compensate for vehicle movement in flight, as well as fire around corners and around obstacles. This allows the user to be completely under cover while firing - a liberty that not many weapons afford. However, during this time, the Phoenix user is completely vulnerable to attack. The Phoenix missile will explode after 250 meters of travel, and will explode on contact with any material. Alternatively, the Phoenix user can trigger the missile to explode by hitting the fire button (default: Mouse 1) to compensate for near misses. The Phoenix also has a dumbfire mode to avoid the vulnerability of using the primary fire mode. Because the Phoenix does do quite a bit of damage, comparable to the Decimator, the Phoenix can be utilized quite effectively indoors against MAX 's. It operates pretty much as a reloadable Decimator indoors, which means it has a slightly higher time to kill, but can still be effective in a pinch. It is probably the most effective of the three empire-specific anti-vehicular weapons indoors. Striker The Striker is the Terran Republic's anti-vehicular weapon. The Striker features lock on missiles, which allows it to hit fast moving vehicles with ease. However, to keep the missile tracking a target, the Striker's reticle must be kept on the target. Also, when a vehicle is locked on, the driver and all passengers of the vehicle are warned, which gives them ample time to react. However, because of the lock-on feature of the Striker, the Striker is the only weapon which can reliably deter enemy aircraft. The Striker's missiles explode at 250 meters. The Striker also has a secondary mode which launches dumbfire missiles. Decimator The Decimator is more of a short range anti-vehicular weapon, and is more designed to be used against MAX units. The Decimator is a 3 shot non-reloadable rocket launcher which fires only dumbfire missiles which do a considerable amount of damage. The Decimator kills full-health MAX Units in three shots, and, while it is difficult to hit moving vehicles, stationary vehicles also suffer from quite a bit of damage from Decimators. However, the Decimator suffers from a huge relaunch time, which usually means a Decimator user has to use cover between shots. The Decimator also features a second mode which shows the user the missile in flight, similar to the Phoenix, but the user cannot guide the missile. Rather, they can detonate the rocket at any time of their choosing, which is useful for hitting moving vehicles, since a Decimator user will often miss moving vehicles. Special Assault Special Assault weaponry is fairly unique, but all of them can be summed up in one word: suppression. Generally, Special Assault weaponry is designed to be used as suppression, to deter an enemy from moving through a certain area. However, each of the three Special Assault weapons are fairly unique. Thumper By far the most popular Special Assault weapon, the Thumper is a grenade launcher which can fire either Plasma, Fragmentation, or Jammer grenades. The weapon can be used on explode on contact, which is useful for lobbing grenades over walls and cover, or on a three-second fuse, which allows the grenades time to bounce around corners. The Thumper is incredibly versatile, but Thumper users must be careful when firing grenades, or else the grief will come in quickly. Rocklet Rifle The Rocklet Rifle is a handheld rocket launcher which fires 6 rockets in rapid succession. With normal rockets, the Rocklet can kill an infantry even wearing a Reinforced Exo-Suit in one magazine. The rockets also do quite a bit of vehicle damage, and can be used as a weak Anti-Vehicular weapon. With fragmentation grenades loaded, a Rocklet operates as an aircraft deterrent, as the fragmentation grenades act as flak and explode in close proximity to air vehicles, which does quite a bit of damage. However, it acts only as a deterrent, as it requires quite a few shots to compeltely down an aircraft. The Rocklet has two firing modes: single shot and empty magazine. Single shot fires rockets or grenades one at a time, while the empty magazine mode, after a short pause, fires all rockets or grenades left in a clip in rapid succession. This allows for quicker kills, but the cone of fire jumps dramatically in this mode. Radiator The Radiator is an Ancient Technology grenade launcher which fires grenades that explode into a very large pain field. This field slowly damages enemies, completely ignoring their armor, and eats away at their health. This includes enemies inside of a vehicle, which allows a coordinated radiator team to kill all drivers and passengers inside of a vehicle without touching the vehicle at all, which makes it ripe for hacking. However, the radiator generally does damage too slowly for this to be useful. The Radiator has two firing modes similar to the Thumper: explode on contact and time-fuse grenades. Hand Held Grenades These are hand held versions of the Jammer grenade , Fragmentation grenade , and Plasma grenade grenades which are also used in the Thumper and the Punisher . These take up a pistol slot, but are actually stored in the inventory slightly smaller than normal pistol weapons. These can be incredibly useful, as they can hit enemies around cover and make them weaker, and lure them out into attacking you in their weakened state. General Use The weapons in PlanetSide are not extraordinarily difficult to utilize. To fire a weapon, use the fire button (default: Mouse 1). Some weapons have more than one fire mode, which can be switched to on the fly (default: mouse 2). If you are carrying more than one type of ammunition for the same gun, you can switch them with a slight delay (default: x). It is impossible to learn how to effectively use weapons through words, but there are general tips that can be learned. Close Quarters Combat At ranges of less than 10 meters, generally, a Heavy Assault weapon is the best choice. Close Quarters Combat tends to involve running at full speed while firing, and not worrying about cone of fire. Strafing is important for dodging enemy fire, and constantly keeping your reticle on the enemy is incredibly important as well. Long Range Combat In long range combat, cone of fire management becomes incredibly important. Generally speaking, fully automatic fire is never recommended for long range combat, as the cone of fire blooms far too much to be useful. Also, at these long ranges, it is important to remember that gravity does play a slight effect, and it effects the slower bullets more. You may have to compensate for this.

There are only six weapon certifications, and all characters have one of them. The six weapon cerifications are as follows: Standard Assault Medium Assault Heavy Assault Special Assault Sniping Anti-Vehicular All characters are required to have Standard Assault, and Medium Assault is the prerequisite to the other four weapon certifications. Thus, Medium Assault is a very popular certification, and almost every character has it.","title":"Certifications"},{"location":"Weapon/#merits","text":"In addition to this, the Heavy Scout Rifle requires no certification, but it does require the player to have a 2 Year Term of Service to be able to acquire it. Currently, the Heavy Scout Rifle is the only weapon in the game to have such a requirement.","title":"Merits"},{"location":"Weapon/#equipment-terminal","text":"After a player has the correct certification or Merit , they must purchase the weapons from an equipment terminal . In addition to this, when they purchase a weapon, to be able to use it, they must have the correct type of holster in their armor.","title":"Equipment Terminal"},{"location":"Weapon/#holsters","text":"All armors have holsters in them, and certain weapons go into certain holsters. There are two types of holsters: pistol holsters and rifle holsters.","title":"Holsters"},{"location":"Weapon/#pistol-holsters","text":"The pistol holsters on an armor are always going to be slot 1 and sometimes slot 3. These are smaller weapons, as the pistol holster is only 3x3. The weapons that use the pistol holster are: All Empire-Specific pistols AMP Spiker Hand-Held Grenades Even though Hand-Held Grenades are fired through the pistol holster, when stored in the inventory, a handheld grenade only takes up a 2x2 slot of inventory.","title":"Pistol Holsters"},{"location":"Weapon/#rifle-holsters","text":"Rifle holsters are much larger, and the Infiltration suit does not even have any rifle slots. Rifle slots are slot 2 and 4, and are reserved for more powerful weapons. These are the weapons that a player will usually use when in combat. The weapons that use the rifle slot are: All Medium Assault weapons except for the Spiker Heavy Assault weapons Special Assault weapons Sniping weapons Anti-Vehicular weapons Although Medium Assault weapons and Special Assault weapons use rifles slots, they do not take up the full 9 x 3 space. This doesn't make a difference in the holster, however, when storing these weapons in normal inventory, they only take up a 6 x 3 space.","title":"Rifle Holsters"},{"location":"Weapon/#ammo","text":"When a player purchases a weapon, the weapon only has the ammo that comes in the magazine. To truly utilize a weapon, a player needs to purchase ammo boxes as well. Generally speaking, a weapon needs at least two boxes of ammo to sustain a good amount of time on the battlefield. There are exceptions to this rule, but this is generally speaking. Also, many weapons have two types of ammo: standard ammo and AP ammo. Standard ammo is white in color, and is designed to take out other infantry. AP ammo is gold in color, and is designed to take out enemy MAX 's and vehicles . The only weapons with these sorts of restrictions are Standard Assault , Medium Assault , and Heavy Assault weapons. The exceptions to this rule are Ancient Technology and Vanu Sovereignty weapons. The Beamer and the Pulsar have an inherent AP mode which allows the user to switch to armor piecing on the fly without worrying about different ammo types. The Lasher and the Ancient Technology weapons are already effective against all type of enemies without different ammunition types or firing modes designed specifically for them.","title":"Ammo"},{"location":"Weapon/#weapon-classes","text":"There are over 20 different weapons in PlanetSide, but they can be classified into a few groups of weapons to make it easier to understand. Each and every weapon has a role on the battlefield.","title":"Weapon Classes"},{"location":"Weapon/#combat-knives","text":"The combat knives of PlanetSide are the Chainblade , Mag-Cutter , and Force-Blade . Knives are generally a soldier's last resort, although many Infiltrators do use the combat knives as primary weapons, usually with the help of the Melee Booster implant. Also, all knives have a Force Attack funcion which allows them to become much more powerful, but it emits a loud sound which notifies people to the presence of a knife wielder. No matter what type of armor you're using, the combat knife can always be selected by using, by default, the 5 key. You cannot unselect the knife, as it is part of the body armor, and you will therefore always have it with you. You cannot loot enemy knives.","title":"Combat Knives"},{"location":"Weapon/#basic-weapons","text":"All characters start with these weapons, as these are the weapons that come with the Standard Assault certification.","title":"Basic Weapons"},{"location":"Weapon/#pistols","text":"Pistols are generally used as back up weapons, although Infiltrators are forced to use these as weapons if they do not use the Combat Knife or the Adaptive Construction Engine . Also, many soldiers use pistols as a back up weapon, since many of them use the same ammo type as their corresponding empire's Medium Assault and Heavy Assault weapons. There are two main classes of pistols, long range pistols and short range pistols. Also, when a player spawns, they will have their Empire-specific pistol with them. Short range pistols are what Infiltrators tend to like to use. These are the AMP and the Mag-Scatter . These weapons are designed to be close range, so, naturally, the Infiltrator, as a generally close range class, can use this to their advantage. Also, many Snipers and Medium Assault users like to take one of these weapons as a close range weapon rather than using their long-range weapons for close range combat. Long range pistols is a slightly misleading name, as these pistols still are not anywhere near Medium Assault range. However, these weapons can be used effectively in ranges over 20 meters, which is somewhat advantageous to Infiltrators, as they can kill enemies outside of the 20 meter Darklight range without fear of being detected by Darklight. The long range pistols are the Beamer and the Repeater , which means the New Conglomerate has no available long range pistol without looting. *Note: The Spiker is also a Long Range pistol but it is classified under Medium Assault and will be talked about later.*","title":"Pistols"},{"location":"Weapon/#suppressor","text":"This is the most basic rifle weapon in the game, and does the lowest damage per shot of any rifle. The Suppressor is incredibly accurate, and can be used for some long range work. However, generally, if a player has a certification above Standard Assault, they don't want to be using the Suppressor. A player spawns with the Suppressor when they first spawn out of a Spawn Tube or AMS .","title":"Suppressor"},{"location":"Weapon/#medium-assault","text":"Medium Assault is one of the most bread and butter certifications in the game of PlanetSide. Almost every character has it, as it is the pre-requisite for Heavy Assault , Anti-Vehicular , Sniping , and Special Assault . Medium Assault weapons are all good in all situations, but they do not excel in any one situation.","title":"Medium Assault"},{"location":"Weapon/#empire-specific-assault-rifles","text":"These are perhaps the most balanced weapons in the game. They can be used in pretty much any situation, be it long range or short range. These weapons are used by many characters due to their versatility, and are especially newbie friendly due to this. However, even veteran characters use these weapons. These weapons are the Cycler , Gauss , and Pulsar . While these weapons can all be fired in fully automatic, this can only be reliably used in close range combat. For longer range combat, burst firing is preferable to keep the Cone of fire under control.","title":"Empire-Specific Assault Rifles"},{"location":"Weapon/#punisher","text":"Another incredibly versatile weapon, the Punisher is not as good as the other three Assault Rifles at being an assault rifle, but it has one major advantage over them: a single shot grenade/rocket launcher. The Punisher, in secondary fire mode, can fire a single grenade or rocket, which expands many of it's uses. The general idea behind the Punisher is to first soften a target using a grenade or rocket, and then to finish them off using normal shots. However, the Punisher suffers from long reloads, as a user not only has to reload the single shot ordinance launcher but also the normal 9mm ammo. Also, to be the most effective with the Punisher, it is most effective to turn Auto-Reload off so that the game doesn't automatically reload the single shot ordinance launcher as soon as you fire so you can switch to the 9mm ammo to finish off a target.","title":"Punisher"},{"location":"Weapon/#sweeper","text":"The Sweeper is the most powerful close range weapon in the Medium Assault certification. As a shotgun, it's use is quickly diminished at longer ranges, but it has a tighter spread than the Heavy Assault weapons and can therefore be used at a slightly longer range. Some players even prefer the Sweeper to it's big brother, the New Conglomerate Jackhammer . However, this all comes down to personal preference.","title":"Sweeper"},{"location":"Weapon/#spiker","text":"This is an Ancient Technology pistol with quite an interesting role. Users can charge up the shot, but the longer a shot is charged up, the more ammo is expended. However, fully charged, the Spiker does do quite a bit of damage with quite an impressive splash for a pistol. Infiltrators tend to enjoy using the Spiker, as it has a fairly long range and a good damage ratio. However, careful ammo management is important to get many kills with it.","title":"Spiker"},{"location":"Weapon/#heavy-weapons","text":"One of the most heavily contested and debated about certifications, Heavy Assault is designed to be at the forefront of any attack. It is the most expensive of any hand-held weaponry certification, at four certification points along with the Medium Assault certification, but you still see quite a few weapons from this certification out on the battlefield. These weapons are designed to be room clearers and have a very low time to kill in close range combat.","title":"Heavy Weapons"},{"location":"Weapon/#lasher","text":"The Lasher is the Vanu Sovereignty 's Heavy Assault weapon. The Lasher features a \"lash\" which does damage to all surrounding targets after a Lasher orb hits the ground, an enemy, or anything. This makes the Lasher quite an effective indoor room clearer, as the wall and the floor will often lash towards enemies and do damage, even if the Lasher user does not directly hit the enemy. However, the Lasher suffers from incredibly slow projectile speed and high Damage Degradation , which makes the weapon usless after a fairly short range. However, because of the slight lash, a Lasher user can hit enemies around corners, which allows the Lasher to double as a weak Special Assault weapon.","title":"Lasher"},{"location":"Weapon/#jackhammer","text":"The Jackhammer is the New Conglomerate 's Heavy Assault weapon. The JackHammer is an automatic shotgun with a rather high pellet spread but a high damage output. It is the only Heavy Assault with a secondary mode, which is a triple shot mode, where three shotgun slugs are propelled out of the JackHammer in rapid succession. This is an instant kill at close range, but due to the slight pause between switching fire modes, the JackHammer's secondary mode is rarely used, unless in conjuction with the Third Person camera. However, even without it's secondary mode, the JackHammer fills it's role nicely as a room clearer.","title":"Jackhammer"},{"location":"Weapon/#mini-chaingun","text":"The Mini-Chaingun is the Terran Republic 's Heavy Assault weapon. The Mini-Chaingun, sometimes shortenned to just MCG, is a rapid firing machine gun with a very high magazine capacity. With 100 shots per magazine, the MCG can pour out quite a bit of lead. However, because of the nature of the weapon, careful cone of fire management is required for slightly longer ranges, but because of this, the MCG has a slightly longer range than the other two Heavy Assault weapons. However, to be utilized the most efficiently, an MCG user must crouch, even in close range combat to minimize the cone of fire.","title":"Mini-Chaingun"},{"location":"Weapon/#maelstrom","text":"The Maelstrom is an Ancient Technology Heavy Assault weapon. The Maelstrom is an incredibly versatile weapon which has both potential for anti-personnel and anti-armor use. In primary mode, a vortex whip comes out of the end of the Maelstrom, which, while it does not do as much damage as the normal Heavy Assault weaponry, can be used if needed. The secondary mode fires a grenade which does quite a bit of damage and can lash, similarily to the Lasher , through walls and around corners. The final mode is the same as the secondary mode, except there is a two-second fuse on the grenade, which allows the weapon to be used as Special Assault.","title":"Maelstrom"},{"location":"Weapon/#sniper-rifles","text":"Sniper Rifles are the handheld infantry weapons with the longest range, and are quite useful in outdoor battles. Generally, they pale in close range combat, but they can be used in close range battle if needed. All sniper rifles come with an 8x zoom, which is very helpful. However, unlike other FPS's, there are no one-hit kills, even with sniper rifles, since there is no are-based hit detection.","title":"Sniper Rifles"},{"location":"Weapon/#bolt-driver","text":"The Bolt Driver was the only Sniper Rifle in the game for two years. It has the highest damage per shot of any handheld infantry weapon in the game, doing 100 damage in total. However, a player wearing any armor besides an Infiltration suit will have some of the damage absorbed by armor, so therefore, it usually takes two shots to down an infantry. The cone of fire is too wide while standing to be used in long range, so therefore, snipers must crouch to do long distance damage. Also, a Sniper must practice a technique called leading to hit moving targets. Leading involves moving the crosshair in front of where an enemy is moving so that the crosshair will settle before they reach it and so that, while the bullet is in flight, the target will move into the bullet.","title":"Bolt Driver"},{"location":"Weapon/#heavy-scout-rifle","text":"The Heavy Scout Rifle is similar to the Bolt Driver in many ways, using the same ammo type and having almost the same animations, but it differs from the Bolt Driver in two important ways: damage and refire rate. The Heavy Scout Rifle is noticably weaker than the Bolt Driver, taking 2 - 5 shots to down an infantry, but it has a 10 round magazine which allows it to be fired rapidly in semi-automatic mode. However, the cone of fire blooms after every shot, so cone of fire management is very important.","title":"Heavy Scout Rifle"},{"location":"Weapon/#anti-vehicular-weapons","text":"Anti-Vehicular weapons are an infantryman's best way to deter vehicles. These weapons are not designed to allow an infantry to solo most vehicles; rather, most are designed to simply deter a vehicle or to destroy a vehicle when many of these weapons are grouped together. Vehicle destruction takes teamwork, otherwise, these weapons are very good at deterring vehicles that would normally annihilate infantry.","title":"Anti-Vehicular Weapons"},{"location":"Weapon/#long-range-weaponry","text":"The Empire-Specific Anti-Vehicular weaponry tend to lend themselves better for outdoor work. These are much longer ranged, and, while they can be used effectively indoors, tend to shine in outdoors combat.","title":"Long Range Weaponry"},{"location":"Weapon/#lancer","text":"The Lancer is the Vanu Sovereignty's Anti-Vehicular weapon. This features a fast travelling bolt which does quite an impressive bit of damage to vehicles. The Lancer has a charge up time of about a second, which means the user has to lead targets not only for the bolt travelling time, but also for the charge up time. Learning how much to lead is a learned skill which takes time. The Lancer has an effective range of 300 meters, which gives it a 50 meter advantage over the other Empire-Specific Anti-Vehicular Weaponry.","title":"Lancer"},{"location":"Weapon/#phoenix","text":"The Phoenix is the New Conglomerate's Anti-Vehicular weapon. The Phoenix features a guided missile, which allows the user to compensate for vehicle movement in flight, as well as fire around corners and around obstacles. This allows the user to be completely under cover while firing - a liberty that not many weapons afford. However, during this time, the Phoenix user is completely vulnerable to attack. The Phoenix missile will explode after 250 meters of travel, and will explode on contact with any material. Alternatively, the Phoenix user can trigger the missile to explode by hitting the fire button (default: Mouse 1) to compensate for near misses. The Phoenix also has a dumbfire mode to avoid the vulnerability of using the primary fire mode. Because the Phoenix does do quite a bit of damage, comparable to the Decimator, the Phoenix can be utilized quite effectively indoors against MAX 's. It operates pretty much as a reloadable Decimator indoors, which means it has a slightly higher time to kill, but can still be effective in a pinch. It is probably the most effective of the three empire-specific anti-vehicular weapons indoors.","title":"Phoenix"},{"location":"Weapon/#striker","text":"The Striker is the Terran Republic's anti-vehicular weapon. The Striker features lock on missiles, which allows it to hit fast moving vehicles with ease. However, to keep the missile tracking a target, the Striker's reticle must be kept on the target. Also, when a vehicle is locked on, the driver and all passengers of the vehicle are warned, which gives them ample time to react. However, because of the lock-on feature of the Striker, the Striker is the only weapon which can reliably deter enemy aircraft. The Striker's missiles explode at 250 meters. The Striker also has a secondary mode which launches dumbfire missiles.","title":"Striker"},{"location":"Weapon/#decimator","text":"The Decimator is more of a short range anti-vehicular weapon, and is more designed to be used against MAX units. The Decimator is a 3 shot non-reloadable rocket launcher which fires only dumbfire missiles which do a considerable amount of damage. The Decimator kills full-health MAX Units in three shots, and, while it is difficult to hit moving vehicles, stationary vehicles also suffer from quite a bit of damage from Decimators. However, the Decimator suffers from a huge relaunch time, which usually means a Decimator user has to use cover between shots. The Decimator also features a second mode which shows the user the missile in flight, similar to the Phoenix, but the user cannot guide the missile. Rather, they can detonate the rocket at any time of their choosing, which is useful for hitting moving vehicles, since a Decimator user will often miss moving vehicles.","title":"Decimator"},{"location":"Weapon/#special-assault","text":"Special Assault weaponry is fairly unique, but all of them can be summed up in one word: suppression.

The weapon can be used on explode on contact, which is useful for lobbing grenades over walls and cover, or on a three-second fuse, which allows the grenades time to bounce around corners. The Thumper is incredibly versatile, but Thumper users must be careful when firing grenades, or else the grief will come in quickly.","title":"Thumper"},{"location":"Weapon/#rocklet-rifle","text":"The Rocklet Rifle is a handheld rocket launcher which fires 6 rockets in rapid succession.

With fragmentation grenades loaded, a Rocklet operates as an aircraft deterrent, as the fragmentation grenades act as flak and explode in close proximity to air vehicles, which does quite a bit of damage. However, it acts only as a deterrent, as it requires quite a few shots to compeltely down an aircraft. The Rocklet has two firing modes: single shot and empty magazine.

Now I could just rush and implement a login server, but with major questions of programming language choice and architecture floating around in my head, I'd rather not wade in just yet. Having a good programming plan will make things easier down the road for me and possibly any other contributors. Original Post Category:PSForever Updates","title":"Weekly Update 1   Nov. 5th"},{"location":"Weekly_Update_2_-_Nov._19th/","text":"Original Post by Chord - Thursday November 19th, 2015 So much for weekly updates...sorry about that! I'm still all for the project. PlanetSide Event I hope everyone had a good time at the probably last PS event ever. The turn out was low, but certainly the highest I've seen in a while. I got some good play time and captures as well. The hackers were not completely destroying the game, except for Saturday when someone pulled people. Could have been worse. Login Server Progress I have more than enough packets for the login server to make the server on my own. The game server is where all of the packets will come in handy. I have decided to go with Scala+Akka for the main codebase and C++11 or Python when necessary. Originally I was thinking of doing the server in C++ like every other game server out there, but C++ has real problems with concurrency (exactly what game servers need to run fast) and any single crash brings the whole server down. Scala with Akka is based on the Java Virtual Machine, but is more than fast enough to do the job. Also I'm one guy. C++ is hard to get stuff done in quick. If this project is going to succeed, I need to not start from scratch. My goal is to have a minimal working login server by the end of the year. I really want the most minimal working server, even it it means there won't be multiplayer to start (i.e. you login but you are alone). That way you guys have something to play with instead of just waiting around for me. Capture Files By the end of next week I will have a quick and dirty capture file upload form for you guys to start submitting captures. Wiki I'm not focusing on making the wiki better for now as getting a server is more important.

Ziplines will move you from their entry to exit points (or visa-versa) at a high speed with or without your weapon holstered (though it is recommended that you keep your weapon out in case you encounter enemies on the other side of the zipline). These transportation devices are found throughout each cavern, allowing access to high buildings as well as rapid movement through the access tunnels and Troop Tunnels .

Vehicles parked too close to a zipline node will be given a warning for deconstruction. Ziplines are different from teleporters in that they are not instantaneous. While traveling on a zipline, you are able to fire at enemies without leaving the zipline, note that enemies can also damage you while you are in travel.

Features and Fixes 1) MAX armor sometimes got stuck in a situation where it could not reload ammunition.

Other variables increase the values from there (type of armor, weapons carried, how long since last respawn), but the base value has been doubled. Battle Experience should increase correspondingly for kill situations. 4) A large optimization to the way we process objects has been made. This should significantly improve framerate when near facilities and large battles. 5) The Striker no longer has the \"raytrace from your kneecap\" issue and now does its raytrace from the muzzle of the weapon, thus preventing LOS issues that shouldn't occur. 6) If the gunner bails on a Magrider , the driver will no longer be left in a situation where he cannot drive the vehicle. 7) There is now a \"Location\" column on the Server Selection screen.

For instance, what was once \"Markov (US West)\" is now just \"Markov\" and there is a \"US West\" description in the Location column. 8) There should no longer be a way to get out of the Options screens without first encountering a \"Do you wish to save these changes?\" dialog box. This prevents players from thinking they've saved their options without them actually being saved. 9) The weather clouds now show up properly when a storm front moves into view. 10) First-time experience rewards are reenabled (without the exploit potential). 11) Several zone crash issues are resolved.

In addition, your purchasing request enters a \"queue\" if there are other players in line ahead of you. All you have to do is stay near the vehicle pad and when your turn arrives you will instantly transport to the driver's seat, as normal. If you leave the area, or if you are killed, your purchase request will be voided and your vehicle won't be created. If you hit Grief Level 4 (a very rare occurrence...it has only happened a couple times) you will no longer be able to reenter the game. Your account will be banned.

Additionally, the outfit decals have been positioned more prominently on vehicles so that it shows off better. (NOTE to all users: If you don't see Outfit Names on players, try hitting ALT+N a couple times. One of the Name toggle settings shows player names AND outfit names.) There will be modifications to the way Outfit icons are shown on individual armors in the next patch to improve the aesthetics. The Decimator icon (in your holster) now properly disappears once all three shots have been fired and the weapon is discarded automatically. You can no longer /ignore GM broadcasts. (Not that you would want to...right?) You should no longer see the energy coils inside the Amp Station sorting through the building walls so they are visible from outside. Users are now prevented from ever being able to end up beneath the world after respawning. TR MAX Dual-Cycler has been changed to do less damage per shot against infantry targets. TR MAX Pounder has been changed so its explosion is slightly smaller and so that its damage-at-edge-of-explosion is slightly less also. This brings the Pounder back into balance a bit, and also reduces its grief potential somewhat. The secondary firing mode of the Rocklet didn't have proper delays set on its aesthetic qualities. That has been fixed now to match the actual function of the weapon. Bridges now show up on the VR Driving area map screen. Added a title to the Sanctuary Respawn window so it's more obvious to most users. WARNING! The Phalanx wall turrets WILL fire automatically again...if your Empire owns an Interlink Facility somewhere on the same continent. Beware the auto-turrets if you're in a flying craft! The exploit with the ACE which allowed users to lay mines inside buildings has been fixed. This will no longer be possible. The Boomer explosion effect now occurs as it should. The explosion will now be visible again. We've added the capability to change your bandwidth settings so as to restrict or expand the maximum amount of data that you're sending/receiving. This can help smooth out gameplay for low bandwidth users and can even allow smoother gameplay for high bandwidth users if they have the pipeline to support it.

Since waiting to finish that would have delayed this patch, we have spent some extra time testing the patch internally and will make it available across all servers instead of first using a test server. The test server will be brought up shortly and will be used to test our continued content updates and feature additions. On to the patch notes ... The Skyguard anti-aircraft buggy is now available for use. Enjoy! Please note, however, that Certification Points can be spent on the Liberator bomber, although it is not available in-game currently. We hope to have the Liberator available very soon. Hotspot algorithms have been improved. The Hotspots now scale up and down in size so that you can see the relative size of the battles in progress. Additionally, they are much more accurate (there is always a battle there now if you see a hotspot) and they refresh much more often. You should find them much more useful in finding battles now. You can now respawn to a hacked building if you are a member of the owning Empire . Previously, once a building was hacked, the option to respawn there was unavailable. This is no longer the case. The Advanced Hacking certification is now required in order to hack equipment terminals or vehicle terminals . The issue where vehicles purchased at a vehicle pad would sometimes fire from the weapons pad (instead of their muzzle points) causing players unintentional grief when they killed their friends accidentally at the pad, has been fixed. You can now assign keys to the camera in/out functions on the Keymap screen. Errant hotspots no longer show up in corners on the Global Map . You should no longer lose your text input cursor when death messages occur in the status window. (Only happened on a few screens, like the /bug screen.) Command chat works properly again. Because \"H\" is typically the hotkey for \"Help\" and because \"H\" was the toggle for \"Hotspots\" on the map screen, there was no hotkey for Hotspots that functioned. \"Hotspots\" now has a hotkey of \"O\" on the map screen. Missiles no longer move with their shell shape sideways. They fly properly to target now. Waypoint beams now sort correctly against hill bottoms and buildings so that the base of the beams no longer shows through those objects. The HART Shuttle is now visible on the proximity map while inside a Shuttle Building. You can no longer see infiltration suits while your view is zoomed. Spitfire turrets can no longer fire at targets inside a warpgate bubble. The exploit allowing folks to get the stealth effect to \"stick\" to an incorrect armor type has been sealed. First-time help tab (on your Character Info screen) now shows all completed first-time tasks. Magrider Heavy Rail Beam projectile now fires in the center of the reticule (instead of slightly above). Players can no longer avoid Phalanx Wall Turret fire by merely strafing left. Fixed an exploit that allowed infiltration suits to equip rifle-sized objects. Fixed an exploit that allowed folks to damage objects while they were supposedly linkdead. You can no longer hack an enemy base if the friendly base connected to that base (on the lattice ) is already hacked. In other words, if your base of operations is hacked, you can't use that base to link to other enemy bases. Therefore, you can't hack enemy bases until your own rear area is secure. 3000x800 video resolution is now supported. You no longer crash if you exit a vehicle while it is upside down. Pulsar was boosted in damage slightly per shot against soldiers. Also, the AP fire rate was increased to match that of Anti-Infantry}Standard shots. The VS MAX Quasar had its default ammo increased from 40 to 60 shots. It's AP damage is ever so slightly less to compensate, but its infantry damage is the same.

For details on what has changed, check here. Empire Incentives have been modified. If all Empires are balanced, they have approximately 33% of the total global population. Every hour, we check the last 7-day period and average all those numbers to see whether there are any major shifts in population. If the Empires move away from the 33% optimal situation, we alter Experience and health in order to encourage new characters to be created in the Empires that need more population. If an Empire gets extremely out of balance, then the numbers finally get to the point where some players with existing characters might consider changing Empires to avoid penalties. This is done to maintain balance within the game if such imbalance ever occurs. Fixed an issue that would cause an avatar to take no damage in certain conditions. We are aware of an issue that causes some stuttering when a player first logs into the game. We have taken steps to reduce this occurrence and will be continuing to make improvements to performance after initial login. The Merit Commendation attachment is now displayed on character avatars. Implemented an option called Adaptive LOD. When enabled this option allows the game to switch to lower LOD objects closer to the camera. This is only done when the current framerate is below the target framerate. This is available through the Graphics Options UI. Implemented a Cull Animations option. When enabled, this option allows the game to update animations less frequently for characters that are farther away. This is done regardless of framerate when enabled. This is available through the Graphics Options UI. Keys bound to Turn Left work correctly. Outfit invite text does not get cut off if the inviter has a long name The Striker will now properly hit and do damage to the Phalanx Wall Turret.

BFR Hangars will be present in facility courtyards. Cavern Captures will not lead to BFR imprinting until further notice. All players will need to be aware that we will be recertifying all characters in PlanetSide tomorrow morning at 3 AM Pacific to introduce new elements to the existing certification process. When you first login to PlanetSide after tomorrow morning, all of your characters will be without any certifications. You will have all of your certification points restored and may spend them again at a Certification Terminal . Kill Stats are now tracking vehicle occupants as individual kills in the stats UI. For more information, see the Development Doc on this feature. Implemented the Vehicle Viewing Direction Indicator and Advanced Color Options. The Direction Indicator can be toggled on and off by mapping a key in the Options UI. Created a new certification tree for Armored Assault that includes acquisition for BattleFrame Robotics. Armored Assault 1 - Access to the Lightning Tank - cost 2 Armored Assault 2 - Access to the empire specific Medium Battle Tank - cost 1 (requires that you have Armored Assault 1) Flail - Access to the Flail - Cost 1 (requires that you have Armored Assault 2) BattleFrame Robotics - Cost 2 (requires that you have Armored Assault 2) The Harasser is now also included in the Assault Buggy certification. While the Light Scout vehicles are now located in other certs (Lightning in Armored Assault 1 and Harasser in Assault Buggies), the Light Scout certification will remain for anyone who is interested in keeping the Lightning/Harasser combination. The Striker and MAX lock-on weaponry now function after deconstructing in a spawn tube. Repeater refire rate improves and a little bit tighter on cone of fire bloom. Flak weapons ( Skyguard and Bursters ) no loger detonate on contact with the ground causing radius splash damage. The flak projectile will only detonate in the proximity to air vehicles or at the end of it's lifespan. Skyguard's ammo load out has been improved with significantly more flak ammunition.

Slightly increased the refire rate of the TR Pounder and Dual Cycler MAX armor when locked down The Lightning and Skyguard's 12mm machinegun cone of fire and recoil have been adjusted to make it much more accurate. Increased the Lightning's armor. Telefragging (killing another soldier by running into a Cavern or Router telepad while another player is standing on the destination) will only occur against enemy soldiers. Moved \"Toggle Chat\" and \"Toggle Radar\" buttons from Hud Items (status bar with health, shortcuts, etc) to Hud Management (button bar with other toggle buttons like Inventory, Character, etc). Vehicles ' access permissions can now be controlled for each type of mount point (Driver, Gunner, Passenger, Trunk). Galaxy and Lodestar cargo use the passenger access setting. Repair Silos and BFR Sheds are now present in Sanctuary and Virtual Training. Vehicle deconstruction distance from vehicle pads has been reduced to make it less aggressive. Vehicle deconstruction times have been increased to 30 seconds of warning. Zipline nodes now have a 30 second vehicle deconstruct timer.

Cavern facility resecures will count toward BFR imprinting. Since resecures will award less experience than captures, the experience requirement for imprinting is less for a resecure. Only one resecure in a 20 minute period will count toward BFR imprinting. Reduction in BFR shield regeneration designed to reduce its battlefield staying power. BFR vs. BFR balance will change with a 1 on 1 able to bust through each other's shields in 25-35 seconds (currently 40-60 seconds, depending on pilot accuracy). Set BFR Batterdown time (the duration the BFR shield stays down after being reduced to 0 absorption) to 1.5 seconds for Gunner variants, 2 seconds for standard BFRs and 3 seconds for Flight variants. BFRs shields regenerate more slowly during their battered down period. Increased the time the BFR shield stays down once it is \"beat down\". This is intended to moderately reduce the BFRs ability to run away. BFR shield regeneration while crouched will only be slightly reduced, to reinforce the tactic (and inherent limitations) of crouching while taking sustained fire. Small reduction to BFR shield's shield total absorption. Increased experience multiplier for destroying a BFR. Reduced BFR explosion radius when it is destroyed.

There is no dependence on the BFR Gunner weapons; the BFR pilot can buy whatever gunner weapons he wants to outfit his battleframe with. This was to keep the gunner from having to actually have the certification to use the gun. In light of the certification changes for BattleFrame Robotics, we have reset all character certifications to allow everyone to reset their character build as they desire. Slight reduction of BFR weapon systems against secondary and tertiary targets. For example, the default AV loadouts did not change in their performance against vehicle targets, but are slightly less effective against infantry, aircraft and MAXs. Moderately reduced BFR shield regeneration rate, but increased the overall amount of absorption the shield will take before being beat to zero.

Experience gained by gunners of a vehicle will split out to the driver and other gunners of the vehicle equally, just like they were in a squad, but without the 20% Squad EXP bonus. The vehicle's occupants can organize into a squad to bring in the bonus! Passengers will not receive any experience. Players will be able to unlearn Certifications that are pre-requisites for other Certs. When a player does this, that Cert and all dependent certifications will be unlearned, freeing up those certification points so they can be spent immediately. This change will give players many more options for changing their character's build over shorter periods of time. When a player attempts to bail from a heavily damaged air vehicle, there will be a chance that the bail malfunctions. The chance of malfunction will not activate until a certain threshold of damage is reached. As the craft takes more damage, there will be a greater chance of malfunction. Malfunctions will affect Galaxy pilots and gunners but not passengers. Passengers and Gunners will be able to bail from vehicles moving at any speed, without making the vehicle slow down. Passengers and gunners will always be able to bail from ground vehicles. Malfunctions will only occur with flight vehicles. Flail damage has been changed. The flail projectile will do less damage at short ranges, and do more damage as the projectile travels further. Players who destroy enemy vehicles will not accrue grief for friendlies damaged in the explosion. The Nano Dispenser , BANK , and Medical Applicator will be usable when a character has weapons locked from Grief. This will allow players working their way through a Grief Lock to still contribute to their Empire through support activities. Fixed an issue where if the BFR servos were damaged while a BFR was crouched, it would retrigger the crouch animations. Slightly tightened the Cone of Fire of the Peregrine Dual Rocket Pod Gunner weapon. Fixed an issue that would cause BFR's to get stuck under bridges. The / ignore command will properly ignore global broadcasts. Players will be limited to deploying 20 Boomers at a time.

Update Highlights Features: Players can create characters from all three empires now. Added an optional free certification reset that will be granted upon logging into the 3.11 build for the first time. There is an option to \u0093Forget All certifications when you open up a certification terminal . Increased the capacity of the Burster ammo box from 50 to 100 Increased the velocity of the Burster projectile (There was some talks that the Burster was having difficulty reaching the ceiling or that the projectiles were being forgotten by the client. We verified that this scenario was false and the point of contention was the speed of the projectile. It took quite some time to hit the ceiling in it's current state therefore the speed was increased to compensate for this downfall) Decreased the refire time of the Burster while unlocked Increased the initial velocity of the Sparrow projectile Reduced the lifespan of the Sparrow projectile to keep their range the same (because the velocity change increased their range which was not needed as it can already reach the ceiling) Created new certification for the Switchblade Changed the Switchblade certification prerequisite to ATV Switchblade armor was reduced Increased the Switchblade's purchase timer to 5 minutes The first time help icon has been replaced with a glowing exclamation point to coincide with the recent art changes. Added BR24+ hats and berets. Characters of all three empires gain the option to wear a hat or beret when they reach Battle Rank 24. The /hat command is used to put the hats on and take them off (the /helmet command must first be used to hide the helmet). Added the \u0093Appearance dialog, accessible by clicking the Customize Appearance\u009d button on the Character pane. This dialog allows players to quickly choose which optional items they want their character to display. Knife holster has been added to both the status bar and the inventory page. Confirmation dialogs have been added for the /outfitkick and /outfitleave chat commands . Made it so it is possible to skip through the Bending and BFR movies by hitting any key. Added more signs to make Training in sanctuary more noticeable Added a timed helper that assists new players by popping up context-specific help as they move around in the game. UI polish and new player modifications Edited first-time help texts for brevity Changed screenshot to PrintScreen Fixed a bug that allowed TR MAXes to unload full clips by reloading right after anchoring Made it so jumping cancels all recalls and rematrixes. Fixed a minor bug where destroyed Router teleport pads would still emit sound. Polished cursor graphics so they stand out better Increased the font size of the session stats window Scrollbar in empire description on the character creation screen now shows only if needed Improved the W graphic on the proximity radar window Platoon default chat color is now bright orange which should be much easier to read Tweaked the third person camera speed to compensate for mouse wheel and keyboard use Increased default mouse sensitivity Increased default opacity of windows to increase legibility. This will only affect new players. Due to player feedback we added \"Invert Map Mouse look Zoom\" as a toggle game option Removed some un-needed space from the Performance Window Continent map now uses a more \"RTS Style\" mouse scrolling where placing the mouse at the edge of the screen will scroll and won't get blocked by windows or the top toolbar. Changed the new character default certifications to have ATV and Harasser instead of Armored Assault I . This was to avoid the confusing \"Invalid Armor\" situation for new players until they are more familiar with the game. Improved the first-time help when opening the map in warpgate selection mode Improved the first-time help when opening a map in normal viewing mode Slight increase in default size of the radar window to better align with other windows Added pop up helps for using weapons and medkits the first time you enter a battle zone Corrected an issue where you could select a row on the CE window leaving a yellow highlight that would last until you logged Changed the Boomer icon to be easier to tell from the HE Mine icon Added tooltips to icons on the CE Window Changed order of icons in the CE Window to mirror ACE fire mode selection order Revised the Certification training mission text so it refers to the correct 6 hour unlearn timer rather than the old 24 hour timer Made it so reserve ammo does not display for Switchblades , Flails , and Cavern Turrets. Since you can never reload these weapons anyway there is no point to display 0 for the reload reserve. Corrected an issue where vehicle timer text could overlap with the vehicle name on the Vehicle Terminal selection window Changed the font used on ammo boxes in the inventory window Modified position of holster numbers in inventory window Fixed bug where the driver of some vehicles would not start in first person camera view from the vehicle pad Fixed text strings that were referring to old window names (ex. Soldier Management\u009d is now \u0093Game Windows\u009d) Decreased default time that first-time help windows stay up to 60 seconds (reduced from 120) Mosquito radar icon should not disappear after traveling through a warpgate . Removed tooltips from the Create Character screen face grid and the Select Outfit Decal dialog. All flak projectiles ( Burster , BFR Burster, Skyguard , and Flaklet ) now detonate upon impacting flight vehicles and flying BFRs. Added Session Stats, Performance, and Combat Engineering to Game Windows window Added window name and hotkey next to buttons on Game Windows window Changed some window titles Outfit Info \u2192 Outfit Vehicle Access \u2192 Vehicle Soldier Management \u2192 Game Windows Organizational Info \u2192 Players (which is more intuitive for the P key mapping) Default key mapping changes Outfit is now O Character is now U, instead of O. While neither is intuitive, at least U is EQ2 standard, and allows O to be Outfit, which is intuitive. Made session stats window default to not showing for new players Changed session and performance stat windows to save their visibility state in same way other windows do. Removed \"\u0093show session stats\"\u009d option from Options:Game; players will just use the key mapping Tweaked appearance of Performance Stats to look like other stats Improved layout of front end screens by grouping buttons by importance, and increasing contrast between back/next and secondary buttons Eliminated unnecessary/erroneous tooltips from front end Replaced X button with more explicit EXIT button Eliminated confirmation dialog when exiting the game In server list, fixed column heading from SERVER LIST to SERVER Changed character creation step 2 so BACK button goes back to empire selection, not character selection Slightly tinted planet backdrop in front-end with complementary color to set off foreground controls more Edited empire description texts so that they do not require scrolling in English Added zone name to loading screen Polished loading screen presentation Removed unnecessary Name header text from Favorites tab on Equipment terminal Changed NEXT button on character creation to read FINISH Removed \"\u0093Are you sure you want to disconnect?\"\u009d confirmation when Back button is pressed on character select screen Changed first-use-help window appearance to contrast more with normal windows, and be easier to read. It also auto sizes its height to the text (up to a point), and only shows the scrollbar if needed. Reversed mouse wheel zoom direction on map; it was previously the opposite of the standard, which is irritating for new players Numerous small tweaks to the popup texts for clarity (ex. changing \u0093\"Press the G key to purchase from the terminal\"\u009d to \"\u0093Press G to use the equipment terminal\"), aesthetics, and brevity. Changed server names from \u0093Markov (and Johari)\u009d and Emerald (and Konried)\u009d to just Markov and Emerald . Disabled first-time help for sanctuary (obsolete now) Tweaked alignment of many windows for polish and consistency Performance stats window and soldier management pane are hidden by default now Commented out behavior of auto-showing performance stats window in response to link dead warning Increased default height of vehicle, equipment, and BFR windows, so players can see a bit more without scrolling. Fixed bug where windows would try to avoid overlapping vehicle damage display; this would cause bad-looking default alignments Fixed alignment of re-spawning dialog; it would move to a bad spot when you increase resolution higher than 1024\u00d7768 Made Invert Flying Input the default, so up = up and down = down, which is a lot more intuitive for new players Hooked in timed help triggers for the following events: First Infiltration Suit First MAX suit (different help for each empires) First equip weapon with multiple fire modes First equip weapon with multiple ammo types First acquire of vehicles with special actions ( AMS , ANT , Flail , Router , Switchblade ) Driving instructions on first acquire of a ground vehicle Piloting instructions on first acquire of a BFR Flying instructions on first acquire of an air vehicle First passenger Instructions on how to bail aircraft and ground vehicles Removed the \"You have left the world\u009d\" confirmation dialog except in cases of link death Fixed very minor visual bug on macro bar (pixel overlaps on separator bars) Gave infiltrator visibility gauge a little bit of padding on either side; it was previously too close together in with H/S/A. Made camera in/out work as zoom in/out while in first person Removed Chat and Radar toggles from Soldier Management. Leaving the key mappings in, in case anyone logs out with them hidden being able to re-show them. Removed Soldier Management behavior of auto-aligning itself with top or bottom of screen. Changed default location of container and rearm windows so that the two windows will not overlap by default. Vehicle pane will come up centered now by default Changed \u0093Toggle UI\u009d to just F10 by default Windows Moved most window toggles into HUD (all except chat window) Unmapped toggles for Chat, Radar, and Star Help by default Unmapped toggle for Solider Management in expectation of it being changed Changed Vehicle to Alt+V Changed Outfit to Alt+O Changed Stats window to Alt+S (so you don't constantly toggle it on/off while crouching) Changed Performance window to Alt+P Changed BFR strafe from Alt+Q/E to Shift+Q/E to avoid clashes with window mappings Changed order of key mappings in list to better group related functions Unmapped toggles related to squad waypoints and experience Removed nVidia and redundant PlanetSide Logo splash screens Made login screen look more like server select screen, to reduce visual pop in transition Removed Help button from all front-end screens, just not necessary anymore Tweaked appearance and default location of Friends monitor Changed exclamation help window to allow overlap Changed default locations of performance window and indicators (crouching, etc) Vehicle direction indicator no longer auto-opened, though players can still toggle it. Fixed bug where UI is briefly visible at start of drop pod sequence Game Windows window closes on Esc, or when button pressed. The idea is to make it a window that you use only when you can't remember the hotkeys. Added \"Invert Map Mouse look Zoom\" Game Option, for players who are used to the old direction Missions Training Missions have been further revised Revised all of the training missions to flash the Next button in any mission step that requires pressing the button to advance and does not explicitly instruct the player to press the button. The button will start flashing after a short delay. The length of the delay will correspond to how much text is displayed in the mission window. Adjusted mission window appearance Added a \"Show Mission List\" button to the Mission Status window. This button appears after completing a step in a mission to provide an easy way to call the mission list back up. Mission window auto-changes between full and minimized views based on whether there are currently any objectives Removed \"Cancel Mission\" button on Mission window. Pressing X now cancels the mission Changed color of \"Mission Cancelled\" text to red Scrollbars on mission window only show when needed Corrected an issue where missions stop or gate randomly preventing completion. Now you should be able to complete all the missions on the 1st try! Missions should indicate the key that you currently have configured for the specified action, rather than instructing you to use the default keys Changed wording of option to \"Show First Time Help\" instead of \"Show Star-Help Training\" Revised the \u0093Map and MAX and Infiltration Suit \u009d training missions. Found the bug that was causing training mission steps to occasionally fail to advance. Fixed a missing string token in the Implants training mission. Fixed bug where equipment terminal and inventory window would appear in a non-user-friendly position during Basic Training mission with default UI settings Removed the HUD training mission Map and Radar Tactical overlay settings are now saved correctly between sessions Removed the default key mapping for the Tactical Overlay as it was too easy for new players to accidentally turn it on or off and not know they did. Unmapped most display toggles by default (all but Tactical); as a new player it was very easy to accidentally toggle something off (like hitting Q and suddenly you can't see yourself) and not know how to recover \u0080\u009cor even worse, not even know it is turned off. (\u0093Where are you guys? I can't see the squad!\u009d) Removed buttons and title bar from radar window Added text display of current range to top right corner of radar. Needed when auto-zooming in and out Continent map now re-centers and zooms out when map switches to warpgate destination or drop location selection, so you don't need to pan or zoom to select. Looking For (LFS) Removed LFS toggle from chat window (moved to status bar) Due to player feedback the find squad pane is no longer launched by toggling on LFS Added \"Toggle LFS\" Keymap (ALT-L by default) Added key maps to tooltips on LFS and Game Window buttons Corrected an issue with the \"Auto LFS On\" game option where you would be placed LFS even if this option was toggled OFF Category:Patches","title":"3.11"},{"location":"patches/3.11/#update-highlights","text":"","title":"Update Highlights"},{"location":"patches/3.11/#features","text":"Players can create characters from all three empires now.

Introducing the Juggernaut , Leviathan and Vindicator ! The Sunderer was examined very closely and it became immediately clear that it didn't have enough fire power. Two guns to protect eleven soldiers through battle lines??? That's just not going to get the job done. So we've added four more guns! Two of the four new guns will be mounted on the top of our newly created Base Crasher and were designed to be empire-specific. This will now provide adequate support incase anyone gets any funny ideas of following too close behind. To solve the issue of grunts running along side, escaping the fire arc of the top guns, we've added small caliber machine guns on the sides. Anyone manning these guns will be given an increased range to their Darklight Implant (if owned). To round out this new party bus, the driver will now be allowed to hop behind the wheel wearing reinforced armor, jam mines and jump on the horn if someone gets in the way. This is one heck of an overhaul! Here is an abbreviated list of features, but don't take our word for it Take one for a spin!

Category:Patches","title":"3.12.12"},{"location":"patches/3.12.20/","text":"Version 3.12.20 (Thursday May 31st 2007) Combat Engineering has undergone a few more changes since Advanced Engineering was introduced. This update should make deployables easier to manage and speed up gameplay. Check out what's new: Equipment that you deploy yourself will be a different color from other friendly deployables on both the field and overhead map. This color can be changed in your options menu and should make identifying your deployables quite a bit easier! Double-clicking on any deployable you own on the overhead map will open a prompt asking if you want to deconstruct that deployable. No more misplacing a TRAP and sitting there shooting it until it's destroyed! Now you can choose which deployable will deconstruct and when! If you leave a planet and don't come back within 60 minutes, all your deployables on that zone will deconstruct (This includes staying offline for over 60 minutes). This will hopefully keep deployables near the fighting and keep other areas relatively clean. If you deploy some equipment with one character and then switch to a different character, your old deployables will instantly deconstruct.

They managed to steal blueprints from the Terran Republic . We don't know how the TR were able to design it, but it looks as if they are developing a method to cloak a flying transport vehicle. With the amount of energy required to keep a craft airborne, we thought it physically impossible to bend light enough to cloak it as well, but with these designs...it might work. The TR are calling it the \" Phantasm \". Also among these blueprints is another design...it looks similar to the Galaxy , and yet somehow different. It's more like a giant battleship than a transport craft. In the hands of the TR, this kind of firepower could be devastating. I do not doubt that the VS spies have also taken advantage of the recent leak in TR security; they probably have the designs as well. We must begin training our soldiers to use this equipment as soon as possible. Our engineers have already started production...we must finish before the opposing factions are able to use them against us. The strangest thing about all of this is the fact that these blueprints were in TR possession. I would expect something like this from the Vanu Sovereignty , but the Terran Republic are narrow-minded fools that only think of suppression using our current technology. Also strange are these symbols found all over the blueprints; they are like nothing I've ever seen before. Shaped like 3 curved blades around a central hub with cyan coloring...what could it mean...\" Taken from a Vanu Sovereignty science report, only one day later: \"...don't understand. The entire lattice has shifted. Our home worlds, Esamir and Amerish , are gone, lost to the heathens that call themselves the New Conglomerate. And we find our own sanctuary linked to the homelands of our Terran repressors, Forseral and Ceryshen . We can only logically assume they have taken control of the former NC territories Solsar and Hossin . This change in the lattice can sometimes be observed as a natural phenomenon of Auraxis . The Auraxian system clearly has a mind of its own and has been known to shift before, but somehow...it is different this time. The readings are not the same. Information from our stellar cartography department shows that this time there has been some form of external tampering with the lattice! We believed ourselves to be the most technologically advanced of the three factions, but after we were given the documents for these new flying aircraft...we must concede that there may be a faction with an even greater understanding than ours...but the Terran Republic? It is hard to believe. We have ruled out that they are capable of such a change, so it must be something else. Could this be related to the symbols on the blueprints? More research needs to be done. Regardless, the fact remains that we now stand on unfamiliar ground. We can be reasonably sure that this is not the end of these strange occurrences. Something is coming. I can feel it...\" The Terran Republic technical reports are stating that the Phantasm and Gunship certifications can be purchased at local certification terminals however both vehicles are currently being manufactured and there it\u2019s been found that some of the supply has gone unaccounted for. As of this report the supply will not meet demands but we have word that the vehicles will available for acquisition within the next week. In addition, the Home Continents have changed. The new Home Continents are: New Conglomerate : Esamir & Amerish Terran Republic : Solsar & Hossin Vanu Sovereignty : Ceryshen & Forseral Category:Patches","title":"3.12.28"},{"location":"patches/3.12.29/","text":"Version 3.12.29 (Friday August 10, 2007) All empires have finished production of the Phantasm and Galaxy Gunship , and are now available to anyone with the corresponding certifications . Here's a few details about each. Phantasm The Phantasm is a flying transport vehicle that can carry a pilot and up to four passengers. The pilot controls a small 12mm chaingun. The pilot has access to a cloaking mechanism that will make the Phantasm virtually invisible. While cloaked, the Phantasm will be undetectable by all radar systems. However, firing its weapon or moving at high speeds may compromise its stealth. The Phantasm is only available at bases with a link to a Tech Plant (or at your sanctuary ). Galaxy Gunship The Galaxy Gunship is a large craft similar to the Galaxy. It carries a pilot and 5 gunners. The wing guns and tail gun are rotary 35mm chainguns, and the two front Ground Pounders fire explosive mortar cartridges (similar to the Marauder ). The gunship is only available at Dropship Centers (or at your sanctuary). There have also been some sightings of soldiers clad in green armor, but they seem to be in hiding as there have been no recent reports of any activity. The objectives of these men are unclear, but they appear to be hostile towards all empires and should be considered extremely dangerous. If you see one, shoot to kill. Bug Fixes Blackouts and flickering lights in the bases should no longer occur An exploit/bug has been fixed where a door would stay open if a player stood directly above or beneath it, even if they were several floors down. A bug that would occur in laggy situations where the first person arms would detach from the camera has been fixed (this was especially true with the Spiker and grenades) A bug that would occur while hotswapping and equipping weapons quickly in third person where the first person arms would not show and the first bullet fired would miss has been fixed. Spawn tube doors, AMP Station CC doors, and big Dropship Center door at the ramp that leads to the Dropship terminal should all open and close more reliably The bug with the equipment terminal not allowing users to acquire weapons, etc. should occur much less often, if at all. The first time event text for the CUD has been updated to reflect when you actually receive the \u201cReveal Enemies\u201d ability Now when a TR MAX locks down in front of a friendly spawn tube, its physics are disabled for friendly players. If the avatar or spawn tube is an enemy, the MAX will still block them. (prevents TR Max from griefing near tubes) First time event notifications can now be closed while viewing the overhead map A bug with the ACE that would allow normal Combet Engineers to deploy Advanced CE if they got the ACE from an Advanced Engineer has been fixed (this also occasionally caused server crashes).

Driver assisted kills will be tracked in their own section of the stats pane. Bail malfunctions will now have a chance to occur when a vehicle has 35% or less armor remaining. Corrected a bug that could cause door IFF Door Locks to disappear at certain Level of Detail settings. Corrected a joystick slider center point default that was not being applied properly. Corrected a issue that could lead to a crash to desktop when respawning. Lodestars can no longer repair vehicles while they are flying. Corrected a problem that could cause you to stop hacking a control console when your vehicle was attacked.

Statistics for Terminals, Generators and Spawn Tubes will update properly. Implants Hitting ZOOM and ESC multiple times while using the Range Magnifier implant will no longer cause stamina to drain forever. Implants and Implant icons will update and activate reliably at all times. Previously, there were some circumstances that would not allow this.

You can read more details about these changes at: BattleFrame Robotics Revisions Merit Commendation Revisions List of available Merit Commendations BFR Specifics: Flight Variants now have 2500 physical armor (down from 2880) Gunner shield regen to 90/sec standing, 170 crouched (45% reduction) All vehicle weapons and BFR AV weapons reduced 35% against BFRs to maintain near current BFR vs. Vehicle balance. This means these weapons beat through the shield slightly faster, but take a bit longer on the actual armor. These changes are for BFRs only - they are unchanged for every other vehicle. BFR Gunner Armor slightly reduced from 5000 to 4500 BFR physical armor absorption to small arms fire removed. Rifles (especially with AP rounds) are now more effective against BFRs. BFR AI and AA weapons made more \"flexible\" in that they do less damage against their intended target and more against vehicles. BFR purchase timer reduced from 50 minutes to 25 minutes. Empire Specific Hand held AV weapons set to where a single trooper, depending on the situation, can slowly beat down an uncrouched Gunner BFR's shields. This is a significant improvement from previous, where a Gunner Variant BFR could pretty much ignore 1, 2 or even 3 grunts with AV weapons. Improved BFR gunner weapons against armor and air targets. Updated BFR and BFR weapon descriptions to better match their revised functionality. Merit Commendation Specifics: Modified a number of Merits colors to make them more distinct. Modified merits as described at here with a listing here, to be more obtainable by casual play, yet retaining prestige for final merits. Added the new BFR Buster Merit Commendation (for killing BFRs) Added the new Driver Gunnery Merit Commendation (for kills made while driving) Increased the [[Hand-to-Hand (Merit) ]]Knife Merit Awards from 3 ranks to 5 (existing merits will not be lost) Added the new Bomber Ace Merit Commendation (for driver assist kills while piloting a Liberator) Kills made with the TR Colossus AI Mortar weapon will now properly count toward the Ground Gunner Merit. Changed Advanced BFR award to require a streak of 7 (given BFR's newer relative weakness) Corrected a naming issue with first rank of Engineering merit. Weapon Splash on Water: We made a pass over BFR, MBT, Deliverer and Assault Buggy weapons with splash damage to have them explode upon hitting water. Previously, some weapons did this and some didn't. Uniformly now, if the weapon has a splash radius explosion, it will now go boom! upon hitting water. Currently, the aiming with projectiles like Prowler or Vanguard rounds, are a little deceptive because you see the whole explosion because of the transparancy of the water and water detection code. We hope to revise this in a future build to make \"walking\" your shells toward a target more accurate.

Sanctuary Respawn To help squads stay together when recalling to the Sanctuary, soldiers will spawn closest to the following, listed by priority: 1) Platoon Leader 2) Squad Leader 3) largest group of Squad Members 4) largest group of Platoon Members If none of the above apply, the player will pick a spawn building at random. Game Play Friendlies will no longer be able to damage base generators or spawn tubes. Flight BFRs will now require a Tech Plant to be connected via the lattice to purchase. Empire Benefits: Locking both Enemy Home Planets will result in obtaining access to all of their Empire Specific vehicles, including BattleFrame Robotics units. Also, the Oshur Battle Islands, when locked, now confer the Dropship center benefit, while Cyssor will confer the 5% vehicle armor bonus. Lattice Change: All four \"neutral\" planets (Battle Islands, Ishundar, Cyssor and Searhus) will always now be connected to the Core Combat Caverns, with remaining links spread among the remaining \"Home\" Planets.

Corrected the Sound Environmental Level to disable when a sound provider was selected that did not support environmental audio. The pop up menu listing that defaults to the lower right will now properly save it's state. That way, it will be minimized if you had it minimized the last time you played. Grenades will now auto-reload more like other weapons Grenades in Inventory will now display how many are in their stack Corrected an issue where the first person HUD did not count stacked grenades correctly. Each Grenade will now properly be a clip of 3. Correcting an issue with alpha and the Wraith .

Squad Leaders can now describe their squad in a short, free form, text dialog, choose which zone they are planning to (or currently) fight on, define squad member positions and define certifications are required for that position., assign squad members to positions, view available soldiers who are flagged LFS that meet the requirements of positions within their squad, and publish their squad to the master list of squads that are looking for squad members. The squad leaders can also save these squad set ups in a special bank of 10 favorites. Solo Soldiers looking for a squad can browse the master list of squads who are looking for members. They can view squad descriptions, who are in the squads currently, the individual role descriptions for available slots and the certification requirements for those slots (if any).

Controlling the Rabbit Ball for a significant amount of time will ultimately result in a benefit being obtained for the Empire that does so. These benefits can vary, but may include gaining uncontestable control for the continent or cave where the event took place for a period of time, access to enemy weapon or equipment, bonuses to experience or other perks.
